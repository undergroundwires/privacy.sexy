      "^"" is the most robust and stable choice.
      Other options:
        ""
          Breaks, because it is fundamentally unsupported
        """"
          Does not work with consecutive double quotes.
          E.g. `PowerShell -Command "$name='aq'; Write-Host """"Disabled `""""$name`"""""""";"`
          Works when using: `PowerShell -Command "$name='aq'; Write-Host "^""Disabled `"^""$name`"^"" "^"";"`
        \"
          May break as they are interpreted by cmd.exe as metacharacters breaking the command
          E.g. `PowerShell -Command "Write-Host 'Hello \"w&orld\"'"` does not work due to unescaped "&"
          Works when using: `PowerShell -Command "Write-Host 'Hello "^""w&orld"^""'"`
        \""
          Normalizes interior whitespace
          E.g. `PowerShell -Command "\""a&  c\"".length"`, outputs 4 and discards one of two whitespaces
          Works when using "^"": `PowerShell -Command ""^""a&  c"^"".length"`
