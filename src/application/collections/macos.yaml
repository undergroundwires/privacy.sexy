                    This category includes scripts that delete various operating system logs.
                    These logs document system operations, user activities, application behavior, and errors.
                    While essential for debugging and monitoring, these logs contain sensitive information and pose privacy risks.

                    Deleting these logs:

                    - Reduces unauthorized access risks to personal data and system configurations.
                    - Optimizes system performance by freeing up disk space.

                    > **Caution**: Deleting these logs may hinder system troubleshooting and monitoring.

                            This category contains scripts for clearing unified logs on macOS.

                            This system is referred to as the *unified logging system* [1], *macOS Unified Logs* [2], or *Apple Unified Logging and Activity Tracing* [3].
                            It was introduced with macOS Sierra [2] [3], version 10.12 [2].
                            This system centralizes all logs, providing a comprehensive and detailed record of both system and application activities [1] [2].
                            These logs are stored on both disk and in memory [1].
                            They are used for debugging [1] and offer insights into app behavior and system events [1] [2] [3].

                            However, these logs also present significant privacy and security concerns:

                            - The logs collect extensive telemetry data [1] [2].
                            - They are often used for forensic analysis to study user behavior [2].
                            - Unauthorized access may lead to privacy breaches, system exploits, and user tracking.

                            Clearing these logs enhances user privacy by mitigating the risk of exposing sensitive information.

                            > **Caution**: Deleting these logs may hinder system troubleshooting and monitoring.

                                    These logs document system and application activities [1] [2].
                                    The data is stored in a compressed format called `tracev3` [1] [2] [3].
                                    They include detailed data about processes, libraries, and events [2].

                                    The logs are stored in the `/private/var/db/diagnostics` directory [2] [3].
                                    You can also access them via `/var/db/diagnostics/` [1] [2], since `/var` links to `/private/var` [2].

                            This script deletes Apple System Log (ASL) files, enhancing your privacy and security.

                            ASL files contain system information such as firewall activity, login details, application errors, and network data [1].

                            The logs are located in the `/private/var/log/asl/` directory  [1] [2] [3].
                            You can also access them via `/var/log/asl/, since `/var` links to `/private/var`.
                            These files are in a binary format [2] and have an `.asl` extension [1] [2] [3].
                            They can be viewed using the `syslog` command [1] [2] [3].

                            Originally, the ASL framework was intended to replace the `syslog` API [2] [4].
                            It was deprecated in macOS 10.12 and succeeded by the `os_log` framework [4].

                            For macOS versions up to 10.4, logs were stored as plaintext files named [1] [2].
                            From macOS 10.5 to 10.5.6, they were stored in a binary database file `asl.db` [1] [2].

                            While deleting these logs is safe since the system regenerates them as needed [3],
                            this action removes the ability to trace or debug system issues tied to these logs [3].

                            Deleting these logs improves your privacy and security:

                            - They include sensitive information about system and user activities [1] [5].
                            - These logs are used in forensic analysis to study your behavior, posing a privacy risk [1] [2].
                            - Unauthorized access to these logs can pose significant security risks [5].

                            > **Caution**: Deleting these logs may hinder system troubleshooting and monitoring.

                            These logs document software installations and updates [1] [2], including dates and details [2].
                            This data is valuable for troubleshooting and auditing.

                            The logs are stored at `/private/var/log/install.log` [1] [3] on Mac OS X 10.3 and later [1].

                            This script deletes the main system logs from your computer.

                            Deleting these logs enhances your privacy by eliminating records of your system usage.
                            These logs are used in forensic analysis to study your behavior, posing a privacy risk [1].
                            This action also frees up disk space by removing files that can grow significantly over time [2].

                            These logs are essential for monitoring system events and identifying unauthorized access incidents [3].

                            The system periodically recycles these logs; therefore, their deletion does not impair system functionality [2].

                            The logs are stored at `/private/var/log` [2].
                            You can also access them via `/var/log` [1] [2] [3] [4], since `/var` links to `/private/var`.
                            This directory mainly contains logs for low-level system services [4].

                            > **Caution**: Deleting these logs may hinder system troubleshooting and monitoring.

                            This script clears the system application logs.

                            The logs are stored at `/Library/Logs/` [1] [2] [3].
                            They include various logs and diagnostic reports [1].

                            These logs are used for system-wide event logging [3].
                            Third-party applications usually can't access these logs due to restricted permissions [1].
                            However, some system-wide apps (like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint [4]) store logs in this directory.

                            These logs contain troubleshooting details and may include personal data.
                            These logs are used in forensic analysis to study your behavior, posing a privacy risk [1].

                            By deleting these logs, the script helps protect user privacy by removing potential traces of
                            user activity and system usage.

                            This growth can reduce system performance and Mail app responsiveness [2].

                            Deleting these logs protects the privacy of your email interactions by removing records of connection details.
                            Additionally, deleting these logs frees up space, resolves various performance issues, and prevents the Mail app from freezing [2].
                            This also enhances the overall stability of the operating system.

                            This script deletes audit logs from your system, enhancing your privacy by erasing records of your activities.

                            Audit logs document activities like file access, creation, and user authentication [1].
                            These logs are used in forensic analysis to study your behavior, posing a privacy risk [1] [2].

                            The logs use the OpenBSM audit framework [1] [3].
                            The framework was initially developed by SUN Microsystems and now maintained under the BSD license by the Trusted BSD Project [3].

                            The logs are stored at `/private/var/audit`.
                            You can also access them via `/var/audit` [1] [2] [3] [4], since `/var` links to `/private/var`.
                            Access to these logs is restricted to the root user [1].

                            Logs are named using the start and stop times of the logging period, formatted as `startime.stoptime` [1] [4].
                            Logs that are not properly terminated are suffixed with `.not_terminated` [1] [4].
                            Log configurations are located in `/etc/security/audit_control` [4].

                            Derived from Mac OS X's UNIX heritage, these logs are produced by scheduled scripts that clean system logs, manage
                            temporary files, and handle tasks such as log file rotation and system statistics reporting [1].

                            The logs are stored at `/private/var/log/daily.out`, `/private/var/log/weekly.out`, and `/private/var/log/monthly.out`.
                            You can also access them via `/var/log/{daily|weekly|monthly}.out` [1] [2] [3], since `/var` links to `/private/var`.
                            The configuration for these log actions are located at `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.periodic-*.plist` files.

                            These logs include detailed records of disk usage, system uptime, and network activities [2] [3].
                            They record outputs from daily, weekly, and monthly maintenance scripts, detailing activities such as removing old logs and
                            rotating various other log files [1].
                            These logs are used in forensic analysis to study your behavior, posing a privacy risk [1].

                            This script deletes logs that record the history of installed applications and updates.

                            The logs are stored at `/private/var/db/receipts` [1] and `/Library/Receipts/InstallHistory.plist` [2].
                            You can also access them via `/var/db/receipts` [3], since `/var` links to `/private/var`.

                            The logs contain details such as the name of the installed package, its version, and the installation date [1] [3].

                            These logs are used in forensic analysis to study your behavior, posing a privacy risk [2] [3].
                            Attackers can exploit this data to target vulnerabilities in applications, compromising your system.
                            Deleting these logs enhances privacy and security by reducing data exposure.

                            > **Caution**: Deleting these logs may hinder system troubleshooting and monitoring.

                            helping you ensure your privacy by eliminating all traces of use.

                            The web application version of privacy.sexy does not create or store user data on your device [1],
                            so this category is applicable to desktop application users only.

                            These scripts are designed for anyone wanting to ensure their script activities leave no trace on their systems.

                            This script frees up disk space, but also improves user privacy by:

                            1. **Removal of stopped containers**: Containers often run applications or services that might process sensitive
                            or personal data. Even if a container is stopped, its filesystem remains intact, and potentially sensitive data inside
                            it can be accessed. By removing stopped containers, we eliminate this potential privacy risk.

                            2. **Deletion of unused images**: Images can sometimes contain sensitive information, especially if they were built
                            from `Dockerfile`s that copied local files or were used in scenarios where sensitive data was processed. Deleting unused
                            images ensures that any inadvertent sensitive information embedded in those images is eradicated.

                            3. **Cleanup of network configurations**: Networks, especially custom ones, can contain configurations that reveal details
                            about system architecture, inter-container communication, or even hardcoded secrets. Removing unused networks mitigates
                            risks associated with lingering, outdated, or insecure configurations.

                            4. **Elimination of build cache**: The Docker build process uses a cache to speed up image creation. This cache can contain
                            remnants of previous builds, including potentially sensitive data or files. Pruning the build cache ensures that these remnants
                            are deleted, further safeguarding privacy.

                            5. **Footprint reduction**: By consistently pruning unused Docker objects, the overall footprint of Docker on the system is
                            reduced. This makes it harder for malicious actors to exploit any lingering or overlooked vulnerabilities in the system or Docker
                            itself.

                            This script runs `docker system prune -af` command to clean up unused Docker data [1].

                            Specifically, the command will [1]:

                            - Remove all stopped containers.
                            - Remove all networks not used by at least one container.
                            - Remove all images not used by any container.
                            - Remove all build cache.

                docs: |-
                    This category provides scripts to reset privacy permissions for a variety of applications on your device,
                    helping you to re-establish control over your personal data. Each script targets a specific permission type – such
                    as camera, microphone, contacts, or accessibility services – enabling you to revoke permissions that have previously
                    been granted to applications.

                    By resetting these permissions, you not only enhance your privacy but also improve your device's security. After
                    running these scripts, applications will require your explicit permission again to access these services or
                    information. This means the next time an app attempts to use a service like your camera or access your contacts,
                    you'll be prompted to grant or deny permission. It's a proactive step to ensure that your sensitive information
                    or system services are accessed only with your current and informed consent.

                    data include IP address of your device, your broad geographical location (country, state

                    It includes third-party advertisements [3] and automatic check for updates [4] by default.
                    Both of these behaviors communicate with online services that reveal personal data about you.

                            The main setting is `ProductPromo.ForcePromoOff` [1] that you can check using:

                            1. `defaults read 'com.parallels.Parallels Desktop' 'ProductPromo.ForcePromoOff'`
                            2. `defaults read 'com.parallels.Parallels Desktop' 'WelcomeScreenPromo.PromoOff'`

                            By default, on clean installations the value is `0` which is equivalent of `no`.

                            There is also `WelcomeScreenPromo.PromoOff` setting that's pre-configured to `1` (`no` as
                            default). It's undocumented but still kept disabled by this script.

                                    This script stops the "Enable Siri" pop-up [1] from appearing the first time a user logs into macOS [2].
                                    
                                    Introduced in macOS version 10.12 [2], this pop-up asks, "Do you want to enable Siri?" [1]
                                    which could lead to Siri being enabled unintentionally.
                                    
                                    This script configures the `com.apple.SetupAssistant!DidSeeSiriSetup` setting to suppress this pop-up [1] [2] [3] [4].
                                    This command tells the system that the Siri setup is complete, preventing the pop-up in future sessions and
                                    enhancing privacy by avoiding unintended Siri activation.

                recommend: standard
                docs: |-
                    This script enhances your privacy by deactivating Personalized Ads and disabling the collection
                    of identifiers related to your device. The process involves modifying certain key configurations,
                    which prevents Apple's advertising platform from using your personal information to deliver targeted
                    ads [1].

                    When Personalized Ads is enabled, your information may be used to provide ads that closely align
                    with your interests [1]. You might occasionally encounter such targeted ads in Apple News, Stocks,
                    and the Mac App Store [2]. Disabling Personalized Ads will prevent Apple from using your data for
                    ad targeting [2]. Although this does not necessarily decrease the quantity of ads you receive,
                    it may result in the ads being less relevant to your interests [2].

                    The primary keys to deactivating personalized ads are:

                    - **`allowApplePersonalizedAdvertising`**: If set to false, this restricts Apple's personalized
                    advertising [3]. This is applicable on macOS 12 and subsequent versions [3].
                    - **`allowIdentifierForAdvertising`**: The `advertisingIdentifier` is a unique string assigned
                    to each device [5]. Apple uses this identifier and recommends its use in third-party
                    applications for tasks like frequency capping, attribution, conversion events, estimating the
                    number of unique users, detecting advertising fraud, and debugging [5]. Although there is no
                    official documentation on it, a discussion on JAMF.com corroborates its existence [6].

                    My tests show that disabling any of the keys mentioned above results in the
                    "System Preferences > Apple Advertising > Personalized ads" option being deactivated in the GUI,
                    starting from macOS Monterey.

                    Please note: The `forceLimitAdTracking` key limits ad tracking [3] [4] and is found in CIS
                    benchmarks for macOS [4]. However, the official macOS documentation specifies that it is
                    applicable only to iOS 7 and newer versions, not to macOS [3]. The key does not exist on the OS
                    by default.

                    This script enhances your privacy and security by disabling automatic detection of captive
                    portals, preventing unintended network connections.
                    However, this change requires users to manually open a web browser to access such networks [1].

                    ### Overview of captive portals

                    Captive portals are also known as *subscription* or *Wi-Fi Hotspot* networks [2].
                    These are common in public places like coffee shops, hotels, and airports [2] [3] [4].
                    These portals redirect users to specific webpages where they must log in [2] [3] [4] [5] [6].
                    Typically, this page requires users to enter personal details, like email and phone number,
                    and agree to terms of service [2] [3] [5] [6].
                    This poses privacy risks because your personal details may be used for marketing or other purposes.

                    ### macOS captive portal flow

                    On macOS, when connecting to a WiFi network:

                    1. The system checks for captive portals by sending requests to specific URLs [5] [6]:
                       - `http://captive.apple.com/hotspot-detect.html` (for OS X 10.10 Yosemite and newer [4]).
                       - `http://www.apple.com/library/test/success.html` (for OS X up to 10.9 Mavericks) [4] [6].
                    2. If the request gets redirected, then Apple knows there is a portal [5].
                    3. macOS opens a limited browser to allow login [4] [5] [6].
                       The browser used for this, called the 'Captive Network Assistant' [4] [7],
                       is found at `/System/Library/CoreServices/Captive Network Assistant.app` [7].
                       This browser is based on Safari [4].
                       Its limitation may cause issues with some networks [4].

                    ### Security and privacy concerns with captive portals

                    Using captive portals raises security and privacy issues:

                    - **Data Collection and Monitoring:**
                      Captive portals often require you to submit personal details such as email and phone numbers [2] [3] [5],
                      which may be used for marketing or sales [3].
                      Additionally, they facilitate the tracking of your behaviors and activities, linking these to your identity [3].
                    - **Data Leakage:**
                      Devices send data about network connections to Apple without user consent [5] [6], compromising privacy.
                    - **False Sense of Security:**
                      The login window may falsely imply that networks with captive portals are more secure, which is not necessarily true [3].
                    - **Misplaced Trust:**
                      Captive portals can alter HTTPS connections, causing frequent security warnings [3].
                      Ignoring these alerts can lower your security awareness [3].
                    - **WISPr: Credential Theft and XML Attacks:**
                      Captive portals that use WISPr technology might expose users to risks of credential theft and attacks based on XML [5].
                    - **False Captive Portals (Evil Twins):**
                      Fake captive portals, designed to look like legitimate ones, can steal sensitive information such as credit card
                      data and user credentials [6].
                    - **Fraud/Fake Website due to MiTM Attacks:**
                      Attackers may exploit captive portals using HTML injection and cross-site scripting to deploy malicious code [6],
                      directing users to harmful sites or stealing data.
                    - **Captive Portal Detection Interference:**
                      Some captive portals hinder or manipulate devices' built-in mechanisms for detecting and managing them [3].
                      This manipulation can broaden your device's exposure to attacks, potentially compromising its security.
                    - **Unintended Application Launch:**
                      Devices may automatically open applications for captive portal logins without user consent [4] [6] [7],
                      risking unauthorized access and exposure to threats like malware.

                    ### Solution and impact

                    Disabling captive portal detection stops automatic login page prompts.
                    It requires users to manually navigate to these pages when needed [1].
                    This change reduces the risk of automatic data collection and unwanted network interactions
                    but may inconvenience users frequently connecting to public networks.

                    This script disables the captive portal detection by modifying the system setting
                    `/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.captive.control.plist!Active` [8].

                    This script does not:

                    - Alter the system application (`/System/Library/CoreServices/Captive Network Assistant.app`),
                      which is protected by "System Integrity Protection (SIP)" [7].
                    - Block captive portal hosts by manipulating DNS records [4] [6].
                      Instead, it disables automatic checks but allows manual access when needed [1].

                    > **Caution:**
                    > After disabling this feature, you must manually access network login pages at places like airports and cafes.
                    > This may involve some technical steps.

                    Disabling automatic updates gives users full control over when and which updates are applied to their system.
                    It improves privacy by preventing unwanted data collection, new vulnerabilities and unapproved changes to system settings.

                    > Disabling automatic updates can leave your system vulnerable to unpatched exploits.
                    > Manually check and apply updates to stay protected.

                            This script stops macOS from automatically installing updates.

                            This script improves privacy by reducing unwanted data collection and ensuring updates don't change
                            settings or data without your approval.

                            The Center for Internet Security (CIS) advises against automatic updates in scenarios where changes require
                            thorough testing and approval processes to avoid operational disruptions [1] [2] [3] [4].

                            This script configures following to stop macOS from installing updates automatically:

                            1. `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.commerce!AutoUpdateRestartRequired`:
                                This preference stops the system from automatically installing macOS updates [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8].
                                By doing this, updates will only be installed when you decide, giving you a chance to check them first [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8].
                                This setting applies to OS X Yosemite through macOS High Sierra [7] [9].

                            2. `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.commerce!AutomaticallyInstallMacOSUpdates`:
                                Changing this setting stops macOS from installing updates automatically [3] [5] [9] [10], giving you control over when to update.
                                If restricts the *Install macOS Updates* option and prevents the user from changing the option [10].
                                While this setting enhances privacy, it's generally not advised by NIST due to potential security risks [9].
                                This setting applies to macOS Mojave and newer versions [9].

                            > **Caution**: Disabling automatic updates requires you to manually check and apply updates to stay protected against security threats [1] [2] [3] [4].

                            This script disables automatic app updates [1] [2] [3] [4] from the App Store [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13].
                            It prevents automatic installation of application updates as soon as they become available from Apple [2] [3] [6] [9] [11] [12] [13].
                            Thus, applications are updated only when you choose to do so [5].

                            Disabling automatic updates prevents unexpected app behavior or settings changes.
                            It helps you to maintain your current app configurations and privacy settings.
                            It also protects against potential zero-day vulnerabilities in your apps.
                            This gives you the ability to choose which updates to install and when, enabling you to review the details of updates before deciding to proceed.

                            The script modifies the following settings:

                            1. `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.commerce!AutoUpdate`:
                                Disables automated app updates [1] [2] [3] [6] [9] [10] [13] from the App Store [7] [8].
                                This setting applies to OS X Yosemite and newer versions [1].
                            2. `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate!AutomaticallyInstallAppUpdates`:
                                Stops the automatic installation of app updates [1] [4] from App Store [9] [10] [11] [12] [13].
                                It deselects the *Install app updates from the App Store* option and prevents the user from changing the option [10].
                                While this setting enhances privacy, it's generally not advised by NIST due to potential security risks [4].
                                This setting applies to macOS Mojave and newer versions [1].

                            > **Caution**:
                            > Disabling app updates means you should manually check for and install important security patches for every application

                            This script stops automatic installations of critical updates [1],
                            including security [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] and system data file [1] [8] updates.

                            It improves privacy by providing:

                            - **Control Over Update Timing**:
                              Users can review updates before installation to ensure they meet privacy standards and do not introduce
                              unwanted telemetry or changes.
                            - **Reduced External Communications**:
                              Reduces how often it connects to update servers, potentially protection user information.

                            The script configures the `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate!CriticalUpdateInstall` setting [1] [4] [5] [7] [8].
                            This action prevents automatic downloads and installations of updates [1].
                            It also prevents users from changing the Install system data files and security updates option manually [1].
                            This script is compatible with OS X Yosemite and later versions [6] [8].

                            The revert script triggers `softwareupdate --background-critical` to install any pending critical updates directly [2] [9].
