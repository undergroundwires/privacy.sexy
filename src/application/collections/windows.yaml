                    This category encompasses a suite of scripts designed to erase traces of a user's recent activities.
                    These activities include files accessed, applications used, and system settings altered.
                    The primary objective of this category is to enhance user privacy by removing records that could potentially reveal personal usage patterns, habits, and preferences.
                    By doing so, these scripts contribute significantly to safeguarding personal and sensitive information from unauthorized access and analysis.

                        docs: |-
                            This category focuses on managing Jump Lists in Windows.
                            This feature was first introduced with Windows 7 in July 2009 and has been included in subsequent versions [1] [2] [3].
                            These lists are found in the Start Menu or Taskbar and provide quick access to recently opened files and folders [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].

                            The privacy concern with Jump Lists is their detailed recording of user activities. They store data such as file names, directory paths,
                            MAC (Modified, Accessed, Created) timestamps, network information, volume names, and file sizes [2] [3] [4] [6]. This information is
                            utilized in forensic analysis to reveal user behavior and interactions with the system [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]. Authorities frequently examine
                            these files for investigative purposes [3].

                            Clearing these Jump Lists is crucial for maintaining privacy. It helps remove traces of user activities, particularly those involving
                            personal or confidential files. By doing so, users prevent the easy accessibility of their activity history, an important privacy measure
                            since these records can persist long after the original files and applications are deleted [3] [5].

                                    This script clears the `AutomaticDestinations` Jump List files in Windows.
                                    It improves user privacy by removing traces of recent file and application usage.

                                    These files are automatically created when a user opens a file or an application [1].
                                    They help users quickly access recently or frequently used items, usually via the Windows taskbar [2].
                                    They are hidden and do not appear in Windows Explorer [3].
                                    The files are located in `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations` [2] [3] [4].
                                    These files are identified by the `automaticDestinations-ms` extension [3].

                                    However, these files also record detailed user activity, such as timestamps, file locations, network information, and usage frequency [1] [3] [4] [5].
                                    They store comprehensive data including boot session times, sequence numbers, user directories, and MAC addresses of network cards [1] [5].
                                    Web search strings from browsers like Edge, Firefox, Chrome, and Opera, used by Cortana, are also stored in these files [3].

                                    By clearing these files, the script not only removes the history of user activity but also reduces the risk of this data being analyzed to
                                    construct user activity timelines [1]. Such analysis could potentially expose personal usage patterns and behaviors, compromising privacy.

                                    This script removes `CustomDestinations` Jump List files in Windows.
                                    These files are hidden [1] and located in `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\CustomDestinations` [1] [2] [3].

                                    `CustomDestinations` files are created by different applications to enable users to pin items such as tasks and files or applications. This
                                    includes tasks like opening a new browser window or creating a new spreadsheet [2], as well as files and applications frequently used [3] [4].
                                    They are commonly used by web browsers and media players to store a user's web history and other activities [1].

                                    The privacy concern arises because these files not only record pinned items but also store detailed data about user interactions. This includes
                                    file opening, modification, and access times, along with the full directory path and volume information [3] [4]. Such information, if accessed,
                                    could potentially reveal personal habits and preferences [1] [2] [3].

                                    Clearing these files prevents the potential use of this data in reconstructing a user's activity history, which is particularly sensitive
                                    when it involves personal or confidential information. The script thus plays a crucial role in maintaining the confidentiality and privacy
                                    of the user's digital activities.

                            This category offers scripts to remove data left by the privacy.sexy desktop application,
                            helping you ensure your privacy by eliminating all traces of use.

                            The web application version of privacy.sexy does not create or store user data on your device [1],
                            so this category is applicable to desktop application users only.

                            These scripts are designed for anyone wanting to ensure their script activities leave no trace on their systems.

                            > **Caution**:
                            > Deleting this data might affect security [2] and troubleshooting [1]:
                            > - Logs are valuable for diagnosing issues and understanding past actions [1].
                            > - Script files can help review changes made to the system and aid in reverting those changes if needed.

                                    The desktop version executes scripts directly on your device [1], saving a script file for execution [1],

                                            This script clears offline telemetry data in Visual Studio. These telemetry data, known as SQM (*Service Quality Monitoring*
                                            or *Software Quality Metrics* [2]) files, contain details about application usage, errors, and performance [1].

                                            SQM files are created and used by Microsoft to gather data for the Microsoft Customer Experience Improvement Program [2].
                                            When Visual Studio is offline, it stores these SQM files locally in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\VSCommon\<vs_version>\SQM` [3].

                                            Accumulation of these files can significantly slow down Visual Studio.
                                            Removing these files can speed up the Visual Studio, as reported by the user community [3].

                                            By clearing these files, this script helps mitigate potential privacy concerns and maintain application efficiency.

                                    This script targets the Firefox browsing history, including URLs, downloads, bookmarks, and site visits, by deleting specific database entries.

                                    Firefox stores various user data in a file named `places.sqlite`. This file includes:

                                    - Annotations, bookmarks, and favorite icons (`moz_anno_attributes`, `moz_annos`, `moz_favicons`) [1]
                                    - Browsing history, a record of pages visited (`moz_places`, `moz_historyvisits`) [1]
                                    - Keywords and typed URLs (`moz_keywords`, `moz_inputhistory`) [1]
                                    - Item annotations (`moz_items_annos`) [1]
                                    - Bookmark roots such as places, menu, toolbar, tags, unfiled (`moz_bookmarks_roots`) [1]

                                    The `moz_places` table holds URL data, connecting to various other tables like `moz_annos`, `moz_bookmarks`, `moz_inputhistory`, and `moz_historyvisits` [2].
                                    Due to these connections, the script removes entries from all relevant tables simultaneously to maintain database integrity.
                                    
                                    **Bookmarks**: Stored across several tables (`moz_bookmarks`, `moz_bookmarks_folders`, `moz_bookmarks_roots`) [3], with additional undocumented tables like `moz_bookmarks_deleted` [4].

                                    **Downloads**: Stored in the 'places.sqlite' database, within the 'moz_annos' table [5]. The entries in `moz_annos` are linked to `moz_places` that store the actual history entry
                                    (`moz_places.id = moz_annos.place_id`) [6]. Associated URL information is stored within the 'moz_places' table [5]. Downloads have been historically stored in `downloads.rdf` for Firefox 2.x
                                    and below [7], and `downloads.sqlite` later on [7].

                                    **Favicons**: Older Firefox versions stored favicons in `places.sqlite` within the `moz_favicons` table [5], while newer versions use `favicons.sqlite` and the `moz_icons` table [5].

                                    By executing this script, users can ensure their Firefox browsing history, bookmarks, and downloads are thoroughly removed, contributing to a cleaner and more private browsing experience.

                docs: |-
                    This category covers removal of temporary Windows files.

                    It is recommended to clean these files as they can be used for unauthorized analysis of user behavior and system usage [1].
                    They may also potentially host malicious software [2] [3].
                    Eliminating these files significantly enhances the security and privacy of the system.

                    Microsoft advises this cleanup for enhanced security [2]. Besides enhancing security, removing these files also frees up disk space.
                    However, removing temporary files might lead to a slight delay in initial application/system load times.

                    By regularly clearing these files, users reduce the chance of malware residing [2] [3] in these folders and prevent the unauthorized
                    use of their information for forensic analysis [1], serving as a simple and effective strategy for maintaining a secure and private system environment.

                            This script eliminates the contents of the `%WINDIR%\Temp\` directory, also known as the Windows Temp directory [1].
                            This directory is located within the Windows system folder `%SystemDrive%\Windows\Temp\` [1] [2].
                            It is used by the system and system-level processes to store temporary files, including those generated by the operating
                            system and other system-level software.

                            This folder, protected by specific access control lists (ACL) [3] [4], is accessible only to system-level accounts [2].

                            Known for being utilized by malware, cleaning this directory is recommended for maintaining system security [2] [5]. Moreover,
                            it's used for forensics to analyze user behavior [6], thus raising privacy concerns.

                            Microsoft underscores the importance of cleaning this folder to free up disk space [7], resolve system application issues [1] [8] [9],
                            and counteract malware [2]. Some system applications may populate this folder, taking up considerable disk space [7] [9] [10].

                            This script only deletes the contents of the `%WINDIR%\Temp\` directory, not the directory itself, to maintain system integrity,
                            security, and privacy, avoiding potential issues caused by unintentional directory deletion without proper ACL. Deleting the directory
                            itself might disrupt certain applications, such as `dism` [11], and application installers [12], while also removing the special ACL

                            This script deletes the contents of the `%TEMP%\` (or `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\` [1], `%TMP%\` [2]) directory, used by applications
                            and processes to store temporary files. This directory is situated within the user profile
                            `%SystemDrive%\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Temp` [1] [2] [3]. Only the respective profile user can read and write to this folder [4].

                            This folder's usage for understanding user behavior in forensics [5] raises privacy concerns. Its content deletion, a regular operation performed
                            by Windows system tools like SilentCleanup (`cleanmgr.exe`) or Storage Sense (`storsvc.exe`) [8], does not harm the system. On cloud machines,
                            Microsoft does not retain contents of this directory and conducts automatic clean-ups to prevent data accumulation [6].

                            This script, while removing the contents, retains the directory to preserve the access control list (ACL) assigned by Microsoft [7], preventing potential
                            misconfigurations due to unintentional folder creation without proper ACL.

                            Microsoft recommends cleaning this folder to free disk space [8] and eliminate potential malware [9].

                            Post-script execution, a reboot is recommended to ensure smooth application functionality accessing `%TEMP%` [8].

                            This script deletes the contents of `%WINDIR%\Prefetch\*`, typically pointing to `C:\Windows\Prefetch\` [1] [2].

                            **What is Prefetch?**

                            Introduced in Windows XP [2], Prefetch was developed by Windows to expedite application startup [1] and the boot process [1] [2].
                            It works by preemptively loading data and code pages into memory from the disk before requests [2], monitoring application's startup
                            page faults [2], and storing the gathered data in the Prefetch directory [2].

                            **Why Clear the Prefetch Directory?**

                            Over time, many files accumulate in the Prefetch directory. Clearing this directory enhances privacy and potentially frees disk space
                            by removing traces of recently used applications and files in the system, making unauthorized tracking of application usage more difficult.
                            Despite its design for improving application startup times [1], Prefetch can inadvertently expose information about the applications and files
                            accessed on the system [1]. Clearing the Prefetch directory addresses this issue by eliminating these traces.

                            Microsoft suggests deleting the Prefetch directory and its contents if significant system configuration changes occur, like adjustments to drivers,
                            services, or applications that start automatically [3]. This action eradicates any outdated prefetched data [3], ensuring that the system operates
                            with the most up-to-date and relevant data for application startups [3].

                            The files in the Prefetch directory are used for forensic purposes [4] [5], adding to the privacy concerns. They reveal information about application usage,
                            including data layout [4], access history on disk [4], last execution time [5], and the total number of times an application has been run [5]. Additionally,
                            they contain historical process information such as loaded libraries and process dependencies [6]. Erasing these files mitigates the risk of
                            this information being used for unauthorized tracking or analysis, improving your privacy.

                            **Trade-Off**

                            Clearing the Prefetch might cause a minor delay in application startup times until the necessary data is regenerated as applications are used again [2].
                            This is a compromise for heightened privacy and potentially freed disk space.

                                            These are logs related to Windows Update [1] [2].

                                            It stores event trace log (ETL) files [3].

                                            While the logs are largely technical, like many diagnostic logs, there's a potential for some data that could be considered personally identifiable information
                                            (PII), such as usernames or machine names, to be included.

                                            From a forensic standpoint, they offer valuable data for reconstructing system events related to software updates [3] :

                                            - **Update History**: The logs can provide a history of updates, including those that failed and required remediation. This could be used to establish a timeline of events on a system.
                                            - **System Integrity**: In forensic scenarios where the integrity of the system is in question, the SIH logs could be used to determine if there were any issues with updates, including
                                            any that were automatically remediated.
                                            - **Behavior Analysis**: While the primary purpose of the logs is not to capture user behavior, they can be part of a broader set of logs and data used in behavioral analysis, especially
                                            when reconstructing events leading up to a particular system state or incident.

                                    This action is sometimes called *resetting the Windows Update Agent* or *resetting Windows Update components* by Microsoft [1].

                                    This directory contains Windows Update files [2] [3].
                                    It includes logs of Windows updates [2] [4], downloaded updates [5], and database files related to the updates [2].

                                    Over time, the size of this folder can increase [5], leading to potential disk space issues. Clearing this directory can help free up disk space [5].

                                    This folder is used by Windows Updates [1] [6].
                                    The `wuauserv` service, also known as "Windows Update Service" [7], uses this folder for its operations [1] [8] [9].
                                    This service manages the Windows Update Agent (WUA) functionality [7].

                                    Clearing this directory is generally safe, and sometimes, Microsoft even recommends this action to troubleshoot and resolve update-related
                                    errors [1] [5] [6] [9] [10].

                            This script deletes primary telemetry files in Windows.
                            These files store event trace logs that are collected by the `DiagTrack` service [1] [2].
                            This service is also known as "Diagnostics Tracking Service" [3] or "Connected User Experiences and Telemetry" service [4].

                            These files are stored as Event Trace Log (`.etl`) files, also known as a trace logs [5].
                            Contents of these files are transmitted to Microsoft servers [1] [2].

                            This services uses *AutoLogger* logs.
                            *AutoLogger* allows saving trace logs early in the operating system boot process before the user logs in [6].
                            This data is collected during system boot and shut-down, and typically read and deleted at each system boot [3].

                            The information collected is divided into two files:

                            - `%PROGRAMDATA%\Microsoft\Diagnosis\ETLLogs\AutoLogger\AutoLogger-Diagtrack-Listener.etl` [1] [2]
                            - `%PROGRAMDATA%\Microsoft\Diagnosis\ETLLogs\ShutdownLogger\AutoLogger-Diagtrack-Listener.etl` [1] [2]

                            To modify or delete these files, `SYSTEM` rights are required [1], which this script provides.

                            The collected data varies based on the telemetry level set [2] and may include information about websites visited, application
                            and system performance, device activity, and memory dumps [7].

                            By deleting these telemetry files, this script prevents the `DiagTrack` service from sending a specific set of diagnostic and
                            usage data to Microsoft, enhancing user privacy by reducing data sharing.

                            This script deletes the scan history kept by Microsoft Defender on your computer. Microsoft Defender logs detected threats but also gathers
                            and stores data about various other files it scans [1] [2]. While removing this history enhances your privacy, it might decrease security,
                            as these logs assist in monitoring threats. By eliminating traces of your system's files, activities and any threats detected, you ensure
                            no residual data can be utilized to study or analyze your computer's activities, thus protecting your privacy.

                            Defender keeps a log of various details whenever it scans your computer for threats. This includes [3] [4]:

                            - **Time**: The moment the threat was discovered.
                            - **Threat Status**: The action carried out against the threat.
                            - **Virus Type**: The type or category of the virus.
                            - **Threat ID**: A unique identifier for the threat.
                            - **Virus Name**: The name of the virus.
                            - **File Path**: The location of the threat on your computer.
                            - **File Hash**: A unique code representing the file.
                            - **Quarantine File Name (GUID)**: The name given to the quarantined threat.
                            - **File Size**: The size of the file.

                            When you first set up Windows, it conducts an initial scan [1]. This scan identifies system files that won't require future
                            scans [1]. These 'safe' files are saved in a unique folder, which becomes a part of the scan history [1].

                            If a threat is recognized, Microsoft Defender will notify you [4]. Regardless of whether you choose to run the file or not, a
                            `DetectionHistory` file is created [2]. This file is stored in a specific folder
                            (`%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Scans\History\Service\DetectionHistory\[numbered folder]\`), and it contains a
                            system-generated ID for the event [2].

                            > **Caution:** Deleting these logs may decrease your security. These logs help in keeping track of potential threats and their sources,
                            allowing for a more proactive response in future encounters. Without this history, Microsoft Defender might not recognize recurring threats
                            as quickly, possibly leaving your system more vulnerable. It's essential to understand that you're making a trade-off between enhanced
                            privacy and potentially reduced security.

                    This script diminishes unnecessary system data, thus enhancing your privacy and performance.

                    The **DISM tool** is used to manage Windows images and is often used to fix issues with the Windows operating system [1].

                    The **"Reset Base"** option can help to reduce the size of the WinSxS folder [2]. Once, "Reset Base" is enabled, you cannot
                    uninstall any previous updates [2]. This script activates the **"Reset Base"** feature, minimizing the size of WinSxS folder.
                    It contributes to the reduction of redundant data, enhancing both the performance of your system and your privacy.

                    The **WinSxS folder**, also known as the "Windows Side by Side" folder, is a component of the Windows operating system [3].
                    It is located in the Windows directory (for example, `C:\Windows\WinSxS`) [3]. The WinSxS folder is used to store system
                    components that are required for the installation of Windows [3]. It also stores components that are added to the system
                    through Windows updates [3].

                    **Windows Component Store** contains all the files that are required to Windows features on demand [3].

                    > **Caution:** Once the "Reset Base" operation is activated, you will not be able to uninstall previous updates. However, this
                    small trade-off improves your privacy and control over system data.

                    This script deletes the Windows System Resource Usage Monitor (SRUM) database file.

                    SRUM tracks the usage of desktop applications, services, Windows applications, and network connections [1] [2] [3]. SRUM stores its file at
                    `C:\Windows\System32\sru\SRUDB.dat` [1] [3] [4].

                    Before deleting the file, the script temporarily stops the Diagnostic Policy Service (DPS). The DPS helps Windows detect and solve problems with its
                    components [4]. Stopping this service is required as modifications to the SRUM file require it to be turned off [5].

                    Deleting this file can enhance user privacy as it contains usage data and is often used for forensic analysis of user behavior [1] [6].

                    Recall is an AI feature introduced in Windows 11 on Copilot+ PCs [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].
                    It is designed to capture and store snapshots of your screen and analyze them [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7].
                    This feature allows users to browse and search their past activities, such as images and text [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7].

                    Recall includes a component called 'screenray'.
                    This component analyzes the snapshot's contents and lets you interact with elements within it [3] [5] [6].
                    This script will also disable the screenray feature [6].

                    This feature is enabled by default, so Windows will capture and store screen snapshots [2] [5] [6].
                    They remain on your computer for months by default [4].

                    Recall captures frequent screenshots, as frequent as multiple times during a minute [1] [2] [4].
                    These screenshots may include all visible content such as app data, websites, images, and documents [2] [5].
                    It may even include sensitive information like passwords and bank account numbers [2] [3].
                    The data is indexed, and the indexes are stored locally on your computer [5].

                    This feature raises significant security and privacy concerns.
                    Experts sometimes describe this feature as a 'privacy nightmare' [4] [7] or 'keylogger' [4] due to these concerns.
                    The privacy risks associated with this feature include:

                    - **Misuse**:
                      This data is stored locally on your computer [1] [2] [5] [7].
                      It poses a risk of unauthorized access to your sensitive and private data [4] [7].
                      Potential threats include malicious attackers, state actors, colleagues, or family members who could misuse this
                      information for identity theft, financial crime, phishing, or coercion.
                    - **Microsoft data collection**:
                      Microsoft's data collection policies may change.
                      As Mozilla expressed, this raises concerns about potential data sharing with law enforcement or the use of the data
                      for targeted advertising or AI training in the future [7].
                    - **Storing sensitive data**:
                      Microsoft does not perform content moderation on the snapshots [2] [3] [4] [7].
                      It means that sensitive information such as passwords or financial account numbers are visible and stored [2] [3],
                      posing a significant privacy and security risk.
                    - **Opt-in**:
                      The feature is opt-in by default [2] [6], and users can only opt-out of certain sites if they are using Microsoft Edge [3].
                      This limits user control over their privacy.
                    - **Lack of transparency:**
                      While Microsoft states that the snapshots are not sent to their servers [2] [7]
                      and that all analysis is conducted locally [1] [2] [3] [7].
                      However, Microsoft has not specified whether it collects the results of these analyses or any related diagnostic data.
                      United Kingdom's data protection agency finds this lack of transparency worrying [4] [7].
                    - **Language model vulnerbailities:**
                      Language models susceptibility to attacks like prompt engineering underlines its security risks [8].
                      More about security vulnerabilities: [Attacks on language models](https://erkinekici.com/articles/attacks-on-language-models/).

                    This script configures the `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsCopilot!DisableAIDataAnalysis` registry key [6].

                    By running this script, you enhance your privacy by preventing the storage and analysis of snapshots on your device [6],
                    thereby mitigating the associated risks.

                    This category enhances your privacy by restricting app access to sensitive personal data.
                    These scripts enable you to enforce the *principle of least privilege* ensuring that apps only have
                    access to the information absolutely necessary for their legitimate function, thereby minimizing potential
                    data misuse.

                    It specifically targets UWP (Universal Windows Platform) apps.
                    These apps can be both native system apps [1] and third-party apps [2] [3].
                    They are typically available through the Microsoft Store [1] [2].
                    These scripts only affect UWP apps, not desktop applications outside the UWP ecosystem.

                    By disabling default app access to personal information and requiring explicit user permission,
                    these scripts protect your security and privacy.

                    > **Caution:**
                    > Disabling app access may affect the functionality of certain Microsoft Store, third-party, and system applications.

                                    The restrictions include:

                                    - Preventing apps from accessing phone call data, including metadata and call triggers [1].
                                    - Disallowing apps from managing spam filters, such as modifying block lists or call origin details [1].

                            This script prevents apps from accessing Human Interface Device (HID) capabilities [1].
                            HIDs include a wide range of devices such as keyboards, mice, and other input devices that can
                            communicate directly with the system.

                            By restricting access, the script ensures that applications cannot intercept or record input data
                            from these devices, thereby safeguarding user interactions.

                    Application Experience comprises services and tasks that help applications, including older ones, run smoothly.
                    These components collect and send telemetry data to Microsoft, potentially impacting user privacy [1] [2] [3] [4].
                    
                    Scripts under this category aim to enhance user privacy, data protection, and protect the system from potential
                    vulnerabilities [5]. They also optimize system performance [1] [2] by removing non-essential operating system components.
                    
                    However, disabling Application Experience could influence the performance or compatibility of specific applications
                    or services on your system [3] [5].

                        docs: |-
                            This category covers disabling of the Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser.
                            This tool checks your computer's software and hardware compatibility with the latest Windows updates,
                            including major upgrades such as Windows 11 [1].
                            It scans your system, collecting detailed information about your apps and devices to ensure everything will work
                            smoothly with potential updates [2] [3].
                            This process helps Microsoft improve Windows and keep your system running efficiently with the latest features.
                            However, it sends substantial system usage data to Microsoft, raising privacy concerns for some users.

                            This script optimizes your computer by managing how it prepares for Windows updates.
                            The Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser, designed to check system readiness for new updates, routinely discards saved
                            update data [2].
                            Consequently, your computer must redownload this data during subsequent update checks, consuming significant
                            internet bandwidth [2] and CPU resources [3].
                            Preventing this redundancy, the script reduces internet usage and improves computer performance.

                            The Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser contributes to Desktop Analytics [2] (formerly Windows Analytics [4]), a system
                            that collects and sends Windows diagnostics and app usage data to Microsoft servers [4].
                            This service is unavailable in high-privacy settings such as GCC High or the US Department of Defense [4],
                            highlighting its potential privacy implications.
                            These organizations, known for stringent privacy and security standards, do not utilize Desktop Analytics, suggesting
                            the service's inherent data collection practices may not align with high-privacy protocols.

                            Despite its utility, Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser can introduce additional vulnerabilities to your system. A known
                            elevation of privilege vulnerability linked with the appraiser allows a configuration file to be susceptible to symbolic link
                            and hard link attacks, also known as the "Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability" [5].

                            By disabling the Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser, this category contributes to enhancing your system's privacy by reducing
                            unnecessary data transmission to Microsoft servers, mitigating potential vulnerabilities, and conserving network bandwidth
                            and CPU usage.

                                    and it maintains this data collection across computer reboots [2].

                                    Running at least daily [3], this task assesses your system's eligibility for Windows 11 upgrades [4].

                                    By disabling this task, the script helps in optimizing computer performance as recommended by Microsoft [1] [2].
                                    This action prevents the task from collecting and sending your computer's data to Microsoft, enhancing your privacy and conserving
                                    system resources.
                                    It also stops the task from checking Windows 11 eligibility, which can be beneficial for systems that do not plan to upgrade.

                        docs: |-
                            This category focuses on disabling scheduled tasks related to Application Experience.
                            These tasks aim to improve user experience by identifying compatibility issues with older software and boosting application performance.
                            However, they also collect and transmit telemetry data to Microsoft.
                            Disabling them can optimize system performance, reduce unwanted data collection, and lower security risks.

                            To view all the scheduled tasks related to Application Experience, you can use the following PowerShell command:

                            ```powershell
                            @('\Microsoft\Windows\Application Experience\*') `
                                | ForEach-Object { Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName '*' -TaskPath $_ -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue } `
                                | ForEach-Object { Write-Host "$($_.TaskPath)$($_.TaskName)" }
                            ```

                                    This script disables the "ProgramDataUpdater" scheduled task.
                                    This component collects and transmits Application Telemetry information for participants in
                                    the Microsoft Customer Experience Improvement Program [1].

                                    Running this script improves privacy and security by limiting data transmission, making it suitable for high-security environments.
                                    Recommendations to disable or delete this task have been voiced by both the Polish [2] and Argentine [3] governments.

                                    Microsoft acknowledges this task as non-essential, explaining that its deactivation improves system reliability and
                                    performance by preventing possible degradation [1] [4].
                                    It highlights that the task's deactivation will not adversely affect other users and services,
                                    reinforcing its non-critical nature [1].

                                    Running this script prioritizes privacy by reducing telemetry data sent to Microsoft.
                                    This choice comes without any notable drawbacks [1], thereby ensuring enhanced privacy and security.

                                    This script disables the "PcaPatchDbTask" scheduled task.

                                    "PcaPatchDbTask" is responsible for periodically updating a specific database that tracks software known to have compatibility issues [1].
                                    When users run a program listed in this database, Windows' Program Compatibility Assistant (PCA) will notify them and suggest a solution
                                    to address the compatibility problem the next time the program is started [2] [3]. By keeping this database updated, the PCA can consistently
                                    recognize and remedy compatibility conflicts, ensuring that even software designed for older Windows versions runs correctly on newer ones.

                                    This database is named the System Application Compatibility Database [3]. Its primary function is to support users in seamlessly operating older
                                    software on modern Windows versions by auto-applying compatibility settings when necessary.

                                    Besides compatibility features, 'PcaPatchDbTask' supports Windows' Dynamic Update process, performing tasks like [4]:

                                    - Retrieving the latest Windows updates and integrating them into the existing system [4]. This action can occasionally trigger antivirus alerts, labeling
                                    the process as "Riskware.Injector.Generic" [5].
                                    - Acquiring drivers that may be missing from the installation media [4].
                                    - Keeping the aforementioned compatibility database up-to-date [1] [4].

                                    "PcaPatchDbTask" was initially rolled out in Windows 10 [4] and it's present by default since Windows 10 21H1 and Windows 11 22H2.

                                    Disabling this task might enhance user privacy by preventing automated compatibility checks and updates. However, users might miss out on helpful
                                    compatibility solutions for older software.

                                    This script disables the "SdbinstMergeDbTask" scheduled task.

                                    The 'SdbinstMergeDbTask' task merges pending shim application compatibility databases, as described in
                                    Task Scheduler (Windows 11 22H2), facilitating the running of older software on newer Windows versions.

                                    According to Task Scheduler (Windows 11 22H2), the task utilizes the `sdbinst.exe` tool [1] [2] [3].
                                    This tool is known as the "Application Compatibility Database Installer" [4].
                                    It is part of the Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) [4] [5].
                                    It allows the deployment of SDB files (Windows Shim Database [6] [7]) to the computer [4] [5].
                                    Before any compatibility fixes or messages are applied [5], this tool is used to make sure applications run correctly, a process called application shimming [8].

                                    This task is associated with the collection of telemetry data [1] [2] [3].
                                    Telemetry data is information that software providers, such as Microsoft, gather about software usage.
                                    By disabling this task, the amount of telemetry data that Microsoft collects is reduced, which boosts user privacy.

                                    Additionally, there have been instances where malicious actors exploited this Windows feature to covertly gain
                                    unauthorized access and execute code within genuine Windows processes [2] [9] [10] [11].
                                    Disabling this task provides an added layer of security against such threats.

                                    Standard administrator rights are insufficient to turn off this task [12].
                                    Attempts to do so result in an `ERROR: Access is denied` message.
                                    To overcome this, the script escalates its privileges ensuring the task is correctly disabled.

                    This category disables the Application Compatibility (AppCompat) framework on Windows.

                    The Application Compatibility (AppCompat) framework is a feature in Windows that collects data about application compatibility.
                    This includes gathering information about application crashes, issues, and other operational details to help improve the
                    compatibility of applications on Windows [1].

                    It is controlled by a set of policies within the Microsoft Windows operating system aimed at enabling applications designed
                    for older versions of Windows to function properly on newer versions [1].

                    However, the Application Compatibility framework involves various forms of data collection that may be considered invasive from
                    a privacy standpoint [1]. It can potentially be exploited to reveal more data about your application usage or to inject your
                    computer with malware [2] [3] [4].

                    By disabling the AppCompat framework, this script contributes to enhancing users' privacy by limiting potential data collection
                    and exposure to malware exploitation.

                            This script disables Application Impact Telemetry (AIT).

                            Application Impact Telemetry (AIT) is a function that tracks the usage of certain Windows system components by
                            various applications [1]. Turning this feature off stops the collection of usage data [1], enhancing your privacy
                            by ensuring that your usage patterns and behaviors are not sent to external servers.

                            Disabling telemetry will take effect on any newly launched applications [1]. To ensure that telemetry collection has
                            stopped for all applications, please reboot your machine [1].

                            Note that if the Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) is turned off, Application Telemetry will be disabled
                            regardless of this setting [1].

                            This script performs its function by modifying a specific registry key:
                            `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\AppCompat!AITEnable`. This is the switch that controls the AIT setting
                            within the operating system [1].

                            This script disables the Application Compatibility Engine on Windows systems.

                            The Application Compatibility Engine examines a compatibility database every time an application starts [1]. If it finds a match
                            for the application, it either applies compatibility fixes or displays a help message for known problems with the application [1].
                            This process may inadvertently reveal data about the applications you run on your system, especially if the query functions are
                            intercepted [2]. Moreover, this database can be utilized by malware creators to modify an application and make it perform unintended
                            actions [3].

                            Disabling the Application Compatibility Engine leads to enhanced system performance [1]. However, this might compromise the compatibility
                            of many older, popular applications and permit the installation of known incompatible applications [1]. Additionally, certain Windows
                            features like Windows Resource Protection and User Account Control use this engine to resolve application issues [1]. Without the engine,
                            these solutions won't be applied, and applications may not install or run correctly [1].

                            This option is suitable for users seeking faster performance who are knowledgeable about the compatibility of the applications they use [1].
                            Keep in mind that any changes to this setting require a system reboot to take effect as many system processes cache this setting's value for
                            performance reasons [1].

                            The script achieves its goal by altering a specific registry key: `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\AppCompat!DisableEngine` [1].
                            By disabling this engine, known to be a vulnerability exploited by malware [4], the script reduces the potential attack surface on the system,
                            enhancing overall security.

                        docs: |-
                            This script removes the "Program Compatibility" tab from the file properties context menu. This tab is visible on the property context menu
                            of any program shortcut or executable file, and displays options that can be applied to the application to solve common issues affecting
                            older applications [1].

                            When enabled, this script prevents the compatibility property page from appearing in the context menus, though it does not impact any prior
                            compatibility settings applied to applications through this interface [1].

                            This script achieves its functionality by modifying a specific registry key:
                            `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\AppCompat!DisablePropPage` [1].

                            This setting is often used in organizational environments to prevent end-users from modifying the compatibility settings of applications.
                            It ensures that applications operate with the settings considered most suitable by the system administrator or IT department. This restriction
                            aids in upholding system stability and security by ensuring users cannot run applications in modes recognized to be insecure or unstable.

                            This script assists in upholding a more secure and stable environment by barring unauthorized changes to application compatibility settings.
                            The security benefits include:

                            - **Restricting User Actions**: By limiting the actions that a user can perform, administrators can prevent unintended security vulnerabilities.
                            Users may inadvertently (or intentionally) choose settings that could expose the system to risks, and this script helps in preventing
                            such scenarios.
                            - **Maintaining Known Configurations**: By ensuring that applications can only run in certain compatibility modes, administrators can more
                            effectively manage and secure their environments. They can thoroughly test and verify the security of the allowed configurations, leading to
                            a more robust security posture.
                            - **Preventing Exploitation of Vulnerabilities**: Some compatibility settings might make applications run in a less secure mode to maintain
                            compatibility with older software or systems. Preventing users from enabling such settings can help in avoiding potential vulnerabilities
                            associated with these modes.

                            By preventing users from changing compatibility settings, you could prevent them from selecting settings that send additional data to
                            software vendors (for example, certain compatibility modes might enable additional telemetry or error reporting). Though primarily aimed at
                            control and stability, this restriction indirectly contributes to privacy protection by reducing potential unwanted data transmission.

                            This script disables Steps Recorder on your device.

                            Steps Recorder, formerly known as Problem Steps Recorder [1] [2], is a tool that records the actions taken on a computer, including keyboard and mouse inputs,
                            user interface interactions, and screenshots with every click [2] [3].This tool is used to diagnose and troubleshoot problems by capturing the exact steps
                            taken when an issue occurs [1]. The data collected by Steps Recorder can be sent to Microsoft or third-party developers [3] [4], potentially revealing sensitive
                            user information.

                            By running this script, the Steps Recorder functionality will be turned off by altering a specific registry key:
                            `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\AppCompat!DisableUAR` [3]. This prevents the automatic recording and sharing of user action data, enhancing the
                            privacy and security of the user's device.

                            Not running this script leaves the Steps Recorder enabled by default on Windows [3], allowing it to record and potentially share user actions and information.

                            Using this script enhances user privacy by ensuring that personal actions taken on a computer are not automatically recorded and shared without the
                            user's knowledge or consent. It's a straightforward measure to increase your control over your own device and data. Additionally, disabling Steps Recorder
                            is recommended by The Australian Signals Directorate's Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) [5].

                            While enhancing privacy, this script may complicate the troubleshooting process as Steps Recorder will not be available to easily record and share encountered
                            issues.

                            This script disables the "Inventory Collector" task on your computer.

                            The Inventory Collector is a feature in Windows that gathers data about the applications, files, devices, and drivers on your system and sends
                            this information to Microsoft [1]. This process is used to help solve compatibility problems, ensuring that your software and hardware work
                            together without issues [1].

                            Running this script will turn off the Inventory Collector, ensuring no data is sent to Microsoft [1]. It also stops the collection of installation
                            data through the Program Compatibility Assistant [1]. By disabling these features, you prevent potentially sensitive information from being shared
                            and avoid uncontrolled updates to your system [2] [3]. If not disabled, the Inventory Collector remains active, continuing to send data [1].

                            If the Customer Experience Improvement Program is turned off, the Inventory Collector will already be inactive, and running this script will have no
                            effect [1].

                            Disabling Inventory Collector is advised by several organizations and authorities for enhanced security:

                            - The Australian Signals Directorate's Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) [4]
                            - The Department of Defense (DoD) information systems in the USA [2]
                            - Microsoft, as part of Windows security baseline for Azure [3]
                            - National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the USA [5]

                            This advice is based on the principle of limiting the amount of data shared, contributing to better privacy and security.

                            When you run this script, it modifies a specific registry key (`HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\AppCompat!DisableInventory`) to turn off the
                            Inventory Collector [1].

                            > **Caution:** Disabling the Inventory Collector may lead to challenges in identifying and resolving compatibility issues
                            > between your software and hardware.

                        category: Disable Program Compatibility Assistant (PCA)
                        docs: |-
                            This category covers disabling the Program Compatibility Assistant (PCA) in Windows.

                            The PCA is designed to help users run desktop applications created for earlier versions of Windows by tracking and identifying known compatibility
                            issues [1]. When an issue is detected, PCA offers the user a recommended fix to help the app run better on Windows [1].

                            **Privacy Implications:**

                            1. **Tracking and Monitoring of Application Activities:** PCA tracks the activities and behaviors of applications to identify symptoms of compatibility
                            issues [1]. Continuous monitoring could inadvertently collect user data, depending on the nature of the applications being monitored and the specifics
                            of the compatibility issues. This persistent oversight could be seen as an invasion of privacy as users' application usage is consistently observed.
                            2. **Application and System Data Access:** PCA accesses data about the application and system to determine appropriate compatibility modes and fixes [1].
                            Access to application and system data might inadvertently lead to access to sensitive or personal information. The extent of PCA's access to such information
                            is not clear from the official documentations, presenting a potential privacy concern.
                            3. **Automatic Modifications and Permissions:** PCA automatically applies certain compatibility modes to resolve issues, such as giving applications
                            administrative privileges or preventing an app from freeing a DLL from memory [1]. Automatic changes in application permissions or behavior could potentially
                            introduce security risks, as apps might gain access to resources or data they would not normally have access to. Users may not be fully aware of the extent of
                            the changes applied, leading to unintentional security or privacy vulnerabilities.
                            4. **User Notification and Consent:** While PCA does notify users and often requires their input to apply recommended settings, some fixes are applied silently [1].
                            Users might not be aware of all the changes PCA makes to application settings and system configurations, limiting their control over their own system and potential
                            impacts on their privacy.
                            5. **User Feedback and Data Sharing with Microsoft**: At the end of each scenario, after the app is run with recommended compatibility settings, the Program Compatibility
                            Assistant (PCA) will ask the user a simple question to gather feedback on whether the app worked or failed with the compatibility setting [1]. This data is sent to
                            Microsoft [1]. Users may have concerns about sending any kind of data to Microsoft. Some users might be wary of potential data mishandling or misuse. It's crucial
                            to ensure that the data collected is securely stored and processed, and that users are adequately informed about what data is being collected and how it will be used.
                            6. **Detection and Mitigation Measures by PCA**: The PCA automatically detects issues with applications and applies various mitigation measures [1]. The automatic
                            detection and mitigation by PCA imply that the system is continuously monitoring application behavior, which might be seen as invasive by some users. There could be
                            concerns regarding what kind of data is accessed by PCA during this monitoring and whether any sensitive data could potentially be exposed.
                            7. **Downloading Missing Components for Apps:** PCA provides a recommendation to download missing components and install them after the app terminates [1].
                            This could involve downloading software from the internet, which may introduce security and privacy risks [1]. Users might inadvertently download malicious software or
                            software with privacy-invasive features if not adequately guided [1].
                            8. **Handling of Administrative Privileges:** PCA handles various scenarios involving administrative privileges and User Account Control (UAC) dialogs, including applying
                            the `RUNASADMIN` compatibility mode to certain installers and applets [1]. This handling of administrative privileges could potentially be exploited by malicious software
                            to gain elevated privileges without adequate user knowledge or consent. It is important to ensure that the mechanisms for handling administrative privileges are secure and
                            not prone to exploitation.
                            9. **Using the Compatibility Troubleshooter**: The Compatibility Troubleshooter allows users to apply recommended fixes to get apps working properly [1]. Use of the
                            Compatibility Troubleshooter involves sharing more data regarding app behavior and issues with Microsoft, raising similar concerns as mentioned above regarding data sharing.

                            By disabling PCA, these potential privacy and security concerns can be mitigated, giving users more control over their data and application behavior, and reducing the risk
                            of unintentional data collection and sharing.

                                    This script disables the Program Compatibility Assistant (PCA) feature in Windows [1].

                                    The purposes include:

                                    - Enhances privacy by stopping the continuous monitoring and data collection by PCA. The PCA monitors applications run by the user [1].
                                    - Users gain more control over their system by manually managing application compatibility issues. When a potential compatibility issue with an
                                    application is detected, the PCA will prompt the user with recommended solutions [1].
                                    - Potentially avoids the automatic changes made by PCA that might introduce security risks.
                                    - It increases the system performance. Microsoft recommends turning off the PCA can be useful for those who require better performance and are
                                    already aware of application compatibility issues [1].

                                    This script modifies a specific registry key (`HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\AppCompat!DisablePCA`) to turn off the PCA [1].
                                    As a result, users will not receive automatic solutions to known compatibility issues when running applications [1], ensuring that they have
                                    control over the solutions they apply.

                                    By default, if you do not run this script or disable PCA manually, the PCA will be turned on [1].

                                    Once this script is executed and PCA is turned off, the user won't be presented with solutions to known compatibility issues when running applications [1].

                                    This script disables the "Program Compatibility Assistant Service" (`PcaSvc`) in Windows [1].

                                    The `PcaSvc` assists the Program Compatibility Assistant (PCA) in monitoring programs installed and run by the user [1], detecting known compatibility problems [1],
                                    and aiding in Windows appraiser data collection [2]. By disabling this service, the script prevents PCA from functioning [1], thereby halting application monitoring
                                    and data collection, leading to enhanced user privacy.

                                    This script turns off the `PcaSvc` which is, by default, automatically started in Windows [1].

                                    Microsoft has clarified that disabling this service does not have a negative impact on the system's functionality, affirming that it's safe to execute this action [1].

                                    By running this script, you prevent the continuous surveillance and data gathering activities conducted by PCA.

                            This category contains scripts to disable data collection capabilities focused on enterprise/business uses.

                            The scripts target various Windows features like Desktop Analytics, Windows Update for Business, and Azure services.
                            These capabilities are meant to provide insights for IT administrators but collect and transmit data from end user devices.

                            By disabling these enterprise/business focused data collection features, you can increase privacy and reduce data sharing
                            from your personal device. However, note that some functionality expected by business IT administrators may be reduced.

                            These scripts can help limit enterprise/Microsoft visibility into your device, but may limit management capabilities on
                            managed business devices.

                                    Desktop Analytics is a cloud-based service that provides insights about Windows devices in an organization.
                                    The service provides insight and intelligence from user data [1].

                                    Desktop Analytics collects diagnostic data from enrolled Windows devices and sends it to Microsoft cloud services [1].
                                    It creates an inventory of apps running in an organization. This data provides insights about application compatibility
                                    and pilot identification to help IT administrators in organizations evaluate the readiness and compatibility of devices
                                    for Windows feature updates [1].

                                    To enable data collection, Desktop Analytics configures settings on the device registry and group policies related
                                    to commercial ID, telemetry levels, and data sharing [2].

                                    While this data sharing raises potential privacy concerns, Microsoft states that privacy controls allow organizations
                                    to limit data collection [1].

                                    Desktop Analytics is retired since November 30, 2022 in favor of Microsoft Intune and Configuration Manager [3].

                                            This script ensures that Microsoft does not process Windows diagnostic data from your device [1].

                                            When activated, it modifies a setting known as the Group Policy object on your device. This object is a set of policies that determine how your system operates.
                                            The script disables a policy related to Microsoft's Desktop Analytics service. This service is designed to provide insights into the health and usage of your
                                            devices but may involve processing diagnostic data [2].

                                            By disabling this policy, the script helps to enhance the privacy of your device by preventing the processing of its diagnostic data by Microsoft. This means
                                            that information about the usage and performance of your device will not be sent to Microsoft's Desktop Analytics service [1][2].

                                            This script enhances privacy by ensuring that the name of your device is anonymized in any diagnostic data collected by Microsoft Desktop Analytics [1].
                                            In other words, instead of your actual device name, "Unknown" will appear in the data [1].

                                            Since the release of Windows 10, version 1803, the device name is not included in the diagnostic data by default [1].
                                            This script guarantees that this privacy-enhancing measure remains in place [1].

                                            When implemented, it changes a specific registry setting, `AllowDeviceNameInTelemetry`, which controls whether the device name is included
                                            in Windows diagnostic data [2]. The script sets this value to `0`, thus disabling the inclusion of the device name in the data [2].

                                            When you use Microsoft Edge for browsing, it can collect and send your browsing history to Desktop Analytics, a Microsoft
                                            service that helps enterprises to analyze and improve their IT environment. If this setting is disabled, Microsoft Edge
                                            does not send any browsing history data, thereby enhancing your privacy.

                                            The script achieves this by modifying a specific value in the Windows Registry. The specific value that the script modifies
                                            is `MicrosoftEdgeDataOptIn` located at `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection`. The script sets this value
                                            to `0`, which indicates to Microsoft Edge that it should not send browsing history data to Desktop Analytics [1].

                                            While enhancing privacy, this could limit the functionality of Desktop Analytics for enterprises that rely on this service
                                            for IT insights. However, for individual users, this script can help prevent unwanted data collection and transmission,
                                            contributing to an overall safer browsing experience [1].

                                            This script controls whether diagnostic data from your device is processed by Windows Update for Business cloud [1] [2].

                                            If enabled, the script can enhance privacy by ensuring that diagnostic data from your device is not processed by the
                                            Windows Update for Business cloud (WufB) [1], an update management service provided by Microsoft [3]. This service
                                            typically helps businesses manage updates on their devices efficiently. But if privacy is a concern, you can opt
                                            to disable it [3].

                                            The policy is applicable to devices joined to Azure Active Directory [1]. Azure Active Directory is a Microsoft cloud
                                            service that provides identity and access capabilities.

                                            Disabling this policy means that some features of the Windows Update for Business deployment service might not be
                                            available. However, your device will gain an added layer of privacy as diagnostic data will not be processed by the
                                            business cloud [1].

                                            Update Compliance is a service provided by Microsoft hosted in Azure, which uses Windows diagnostic data [1].
                                            This service doesn't meet the US Government community compliance (GCC) requirements [1], and is utilized by
                                            both Desktop Analytics and Azure Update Management [1].

                                            This script is designed to disable the Update Compliance processing of diagnostic data on your device. When
                                            this script is run, it modifies the system registry to prevent diagnostic data from your device being processed
                                            by Update Compliance. This change in settings increases the privacy of your device by limiting the diagnostic data
                                            that can be accessed and analyzed by Microsoft's services.

                                            Diagnostic data, in this context, includes information about device health, system events, and usage metrics. By
                                            disabling the processing of this data, the script helps protect the privacy of your activities on your device [1].

                                            This script can be reversed at any time by using the provided `revertCode` if you decide to re-enable the processing
                                            of diagnostic data by Update Compliance.

                                            In technical terms, the script sets the `AllowUpdateComplianceProcessing` value in the
                                            `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection` registry path to 0, which disables the processing of
                                            diagnostic data by Update Compliance [2].

                                    This protects your privacy by placing a limit on the commercial usage of your data. It manages
                                    how Windows diagnostic data is handled by controlling whether Microsoft is a processor or controller
                                    for Windows diagnostic data collected from your device [1] [2].

                                    In the default setting, Microsoft operates as the controller of this diagnostic data, thus enabling it to use the data
                                    for commercial purposes. This script alters that setting to limit the commercial usage of your data [1] [2].

                                    This script does not affect the operation of optional analytics processor services like Desktop Analytics and
                                    Windows Update for Business reports. Moreover, it doesn't change whether diagnostic data is collected or the ability
                                    of the user to change the level.

                        docs: |-
                            This script improves your privacy by blocking the transmission of diagnostic and usage telemetry data
                            from your Windows device [1]. This includes data about your device's usage, app compatibility, and
                            system performance, which can be sensitive in nature. By stopping this data from being sent, you reduce
                            the amount of personal information that could potentially be accessed by third parties.

                            The script works by configuring the Group Policy Object (GPO) and Local Policy preferences, which
                            essentially govern your device's data sharing policies [2]. These modifications restrict the data that Windows
                            and its built-in apps can collect and send.

                            Upon executing this script, Desktop Analytics will be disabled, as it relies on basic diagnostic data to
                            function [2]. Desktop Analytics is a cloud-based service provided by Microsoft [4]. It provides insights
                            and intelligence for IT administrators [4]. Desktop Analytics is deprecated and was retired on November 30, 2022.

                            Once this script is executed, even if the policy permits a telemetry setting of Security or Basic, users
                            will not have the capability to opt for a higher data sharing level [3]. This restriction is limited to the
                            operating system and apps included with Windows, and does not pertain to third-party apps installed on your
                            device [3].

                            This script is recommended by CIS Microsoft Windows Desktop Benchmarks [1]. Please be aware that turning off this service might
                            affect how certain apps that rely on this service work [3].

                            The script changes a registry setting to disable OneSettings downloads [3] [1]. It also provides a revert code to undo this change,
                            if needed, which returns the system to its previous state.

                            If you want to limit how much data is sent to Microsoft, turning off the OneSettings service can help enhance your privacy [1].

                            [learn.microsoft.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20230803025857/https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/privacy/basic-level-windows-diagnostic-events-and-fields-1809).

                            This script lets you manage your privacy by restricting the automatic configuration updates of Windows components and apps,
                            including telemetry services, from the cloud [3] [1].

                            By using this script, Windows will not connect to OneSettings to fetch any configuration settings [1].
                            This reduces the amount of data sent to third-party vendors, which can help alleviate potential security concerns [1].

                            However, please be aware that while this setting can enhance privacy, turning off this service could lead to some applications
                            not working properly. These applications may depend on dynamic configuration updates that will be stopped when the service is
                            disabled [3] [1].

                            This script disables the Windows Error Reporting (WER) feature.

                            Windows Error Reporting collects and sends error logs from your computer to Microsoft [1], which can be a potential privacy concern for users.
                            By disabling it, this script ensures that your system errors remain local to your machine and are not sent to external servers.

                            Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

                            1. **Registry Changes**: The script modifies specific registry entries to disable the WER functionality and its related settings.

                            2. **Scheduled Tasks**: The script disables scheduled tasks related to error details updates and queue reporting.

                            3. **Services**: The script disables the services related to error reporting.

                            ### Registry changes

                        docs: |-
                            Windows Delivery Optimization is a feature introduced by Microsoft to facilitate a more efficient downloading process for Windows
                            updates, upgrades, and applications [1] [2]. Instead of exclusively relying on Microsoft's servers, this feature identifies other
                            PCs on a user's local network or even across the internet that already possess the desired updates or applications [2]. By breaking
                            the download into smaller segments and fetching each from the fastest and most reliable source, which can include other PCs, the
                            system ensures more efficient downloads [2]. To support this process, Delivery Optimization uses a local cache to temporarily store
                            downloaded files [2].

                            While Delivery Optimization is designed for speed and reliability, its operation raises privacy concerns. Specifically, when enabled,
                            it can distribute updates and applications from one user's PC to others [2], sharing users' data such as their IP addresses [3].

                            Benefits of disabling Delivery Optimization for privacy:

                            - **Minimizing Data Sharing**: By turning off Delivery Optimization, users ensure that updates and apps are neither downloaded from nor sent
                            to other devices [2]. This guarantees that all data remains strictly on the user's device [2] and the user IP is not shared [3].
                            - **Storage Conservation**: Users can save storage space by eliminating the local cache utilized by Delivery Optimization.
                            - **Guaranteed Source Authenticity**: Although Microsoft ensures the authenticity of updates and apps shared via Delivery Optimization [2],
                            disabling the feature guarantees that all updates and apps come directly from Microsoft's servers, eliminating potential intermediaries.
                            - **Bandwidth Conservation**: With the feature off, updates are restricted to direct downloads from Microsoft [1]. This is beneficial
                            for users on metered or capped internet connections, as it allows for more effective bandwidth monitoring [2].
                            - **Enhanced Security**: Devices using Delivery Optimization open port 7680 to accept peer requests [4]. Disabling the feature avoids this,
                            ensuring users are not exposed to unwanted inbound traffic and enhancing security [5].
                            - **VPN Protection**: Although Delivery Optimization attempts to detect VPNs and halts uploads when a VPN connection is detected [4], disabling
                            it removes any risk of unintended data sharing over a VPN.

                            Notably, the USA government [5] and Department of Defense (DoD) in the USA [6] recommends disabling this feature.

                                    This script modifies Delivery Optimization's download method for Windows Updates [1] to disable peering. When this script is run, it sets the
                                    download method to `0`, which means "HTTP only, no peering" [1] [2]. As a result, Windows Updates are downloaded solely from the internet and
                                    not from other computers on the network (referred to as "peer-to-peer") [3].

                                    Peer-to-peer is a method where multiple computers share data amongst themselves. For Windows Updates, the default setting is for computers
                                    within a network to share updates (called LAN mode, represented by the value `1`) [1] [2].

                                    Changing the setting to "HTTP only" reduces potential vulnerabilities [3]. When updates are fetched only from official servers, there's
                                    less chance of unwanted or malicious data entering the system. This is why the Department of Defense (DoD) in the USA [4] and USA government [3]
                                    recommends this setting. They assert that leaving it in its default configuration could expose the system to additional risks [3].

                                    Delivery Optimization is a Windows feature that provides the Windows Updates through peer-to-peer sharing [1]. In simple terms, instead of solely
                                    relying on Microsoft's servers for updates, your computer can also fetch them from other devices that already possess the necessary files.

                                    The "Delivery Optimization" service manages these content delivery tasks [2] [3]. It orchestrates the retrieval of updates both from other Windows users [3].
                                    In doing so, it connects to various Microsoft service points to collect data, such as policies, content details, device specifications, and information about
                                    other Windows users [3]. This data sharing raises privacy concerns.

                                    This service also logs IP addresses [4] of peers which can be considered personal data. It listens on port 7680 for TCP/UDP traffic [5] that may expose the user
                                    to unwanted inbound traffic and enhancing security [6].

                                    By default, the "Delivery Optimization" service is set to start automatically when Windows boots up [2]. This script alters that behavior, ensuring
                                    it doesn't run unless explicitly started by the user.

                                    Taking control of this service prevents Microsoft from activating peer-to-peer sharing, enhancing user privacy. It ensures your device doesn't share update data
                                    or fetch it from arbitrary peers.

                                    > **Caution:** Disabling this service affects the functionality of Windows Store. It plays a role not just in Windows Updates but also in Microsoft Store app
                                    downloads, especially since Windows 11 [7]. There have been reported issues with some app downloads on Windows 10 [8].

                category: Disable Windows search data collection
                docs: |-
                    This category is dedicated to minimizing the personal data collected and utilized by Windows Search and Cortana.
                    It encompasses a range of scripts designed to curtail data sharing and bolster user privacy.
                    These scripts are crucial for preventing the search function from transmitting sensitive information such as
                    search history, account details, and location data to Microsoft's servers.

                    The Windows search functionality, often integrated with Cortana [1], is a key feature that allows for data collection
                    through various means. This includes gathering user searches, contacts, location data, voice inputs, browsing history,
                    and details from emails, calendars, and communication history [2].

                    The voice data thus collected aids in refining language understanding and machine learning models [2]. Furthermore,
                    Cortana's use of location data provides contextually relevant answers and suggestions, often estimating the user's
                    location via their IP address [2]. This feature extends to web browsing as well, where Cortana utilizes Microsoft Edge
                    browsing history for personalized suggestions [2].

                    Contacts, calendar details, and email information are also accessed by Cortana to track and offer tailored suggestions [2]
                    Additionally, when signed in, chat history with Cortana is retained, and typed searches are transmitted to Bing for
                    enhanced recommendation quality, even when Cortana is not actively in use [2].

                    By using the scripts in this category, users can significantly enhance their privacy and security.
                    These scripts enable users to control the extent of their personal data used by Windows, thereby ensuring a more secure
                    and private search experience.

                            This category targets the reduction of Cortana's data collection practices.

                            Cortana, Microsoft's digital assistant, integrates deeply with Windows Search to provide personalized
                            assistance based on user data.

                            By disabling Cortana's data collection features, this category aims to enhance user privacy by preventing the
                            sharing of sensitive information with Microsoft.

                            The scripts within this category provide users with the tools to limit Cortana's reach into their personal data,
                            thereby fostering a more private and secure digital environment.

                                    This category focuses on preventing Cortana from storing and displaying user interaction history.

                                    When enabled, Cortana collects data on user activities, such as interactions with the assistant and search queries,
                                    to personalize the user experience.
                                    This collection can be a privacy concern as it involves the retention and potential analysis of personal behavior patterns.

                                    By disabling this feature, users can prevent their activity history from being used for customization or other purposes,
                                    thereby enhancing their privacy and potentially improving system performance by reducing background data processing tasks.

                                    By default, Cortana can actively listen for voice input, which may include capturing and processing speech patterns and
                                    potentially sensitive spoken content.
                                    This capability raises privacy issues as voice data is often processed and stored remotely.

                                    Disabling Cortana's voice listening features ensures that conversations or background noises are not inadvertently
                                    recorded or analyzed, providing users with a greater level of privacy in their personal or work environments.

                                    of various file protocols [2] [3].
                                    By default, Windows Desktop Search can use any installed iFilters and protocol handlers [1], which might
                                    pose a security risk if untrusted components are used.

                                    The script configures the system to only use iFilters and protocol handlers that are explicitly listed in an 'allow list' [1].
                                    It does not prevent the installation of new iFilters or protocol handlers, nor does it restrict their use by other applications [1].

                                    This measure is particularly useful for preventing unauthorized or potentially harmful search-related add-ins from being used by
                                    Windows Desktop Search, thereby enhancing the overall security of the system.

                            This script blocks both the Windows search function and Cortana, Microsoft's virtual assistant, from
                            accessing your device's location data [1].
                            
                            By default, Microsoft processes location data, impacting user privacy [2].

                            The U.S. Internal Revenue Service advises restricting access to this data to improve security, given the
                            sensitivity of location information [3].

                            Once this script is applied, search and Cortana will no longer be able to provide results based on the user's
                            location [1], thus enhancing privacy.

                            The script accomplishes this by modifying the following registry keys:
                            
                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Search!AllowSearchToUseLocation` [1] [2]

                            Windows, commonly associated with Cortana [1].
                            Cortana is a digital assistant integrated into Windows Search, capable of collecting extensive
                            personal data to provide its services [2].
                            This includes your search queries, contact information, location, voice inputs, browsing history,
                            and details from emails, calendars, and communication history [2].

                            These scripts are designed to limit the amount of personal data shared with Microsoft, preventing your
                            typed searches from being sent to Bing for search recommendations, even when Cortana is inactive [2].

                                    This script improves privacy by disabling Bing search in the Start menu and recent search suggestions in File Explorer [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].

                                    By default, Windows 10's Search Box includes suggestions from the Internet, alongside local search results [4] [5] [6] [7].
                                    This script limits the search results to your local machine, improving privacy by not sending data to Microsoft servers [2].

                                    The script:

                                    - Stops Bing web search integration in the Start menu [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].
                                    - Disables recent search suggestions in File Explorer [5] [6] [7].
                                    - Prevents search entries from being stored in the registry for future use [5] [6] [7].

                                    > **Caution:** Running this script will remove Bing web search [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] and recent query suggestions

                                    This script modifies:

                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer!DisableSearchBoxSuggestions` [2] [3] [4].
                                    - `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Search!DisableSearchBoxSuggestions` [8] [9].

                                    These keys replace older `BingSearchEnabled` registry value [2] [3].
                                    They apply to Windows 10 versions post 1909, including Windows 10 v2004 (20H1) and higher [5] [9].

                                    This script improves your privacy by disabling the display of web results in the Windows Search function [1] [2].
                                    This prevents your search terms from being sent to Microsoft servers [3].

                                    By default, the Windows Start menu Search box shows results from your computer, the Windows Store, and Bing's web search results [4].
                                    This default behavior [2] means your queries are shared with Microsoft, which could impact your privacy [3].

                                    Running this script stops the Start menu search from performing web searches and displaying web results [1] [2],
                                    both generally and over metered connections [5], ensuring your searches remain local to your device [3] [5].

                                    When executed, this script modifies the following registry keys:

                                    This script disables the search highlights feature in the taskbar search box.

                                    By default [1] [2], search highlights present content like holidays, anniversaries, and other special events,
                                    both globally and regionally [1]. This feature, available since Windows 10 and 11 version 2004 [1] [3] [4],
                                    periodically updates with content, including illustrations and text in the search box [1].

                                    However, using search highlights can impact your privacy.
                                    This feature is even considered a security vulnerability [2].
                                    It reduces privacy by communicating personalized content including updates from
                                    your organization, suggested people, files, and more [3]. Acknowledging this privacy concern, Windows provides
                                    settings in the "Privacy & security" section to manage it [3].

                                    This script adjusts following registry keys to turn off this feature:

                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Search!EnableDynamicContentInWSB` [4] [2] [5]

                            When executed, the script prevents the operating system from storing search queries in the registry [1] [2].

                            However, suggestions based on local content from apps or Windows itself will remain available [1] [2].

                            The National Security Agency (NSA) in the USA recommends this setting for enhanced privacy and security [3].

                            By default, Windows provides search suggestions based on previous searches [1] [2] [4].
                            Running this script disables this feature, thereby enhancing privacy.

                            The script configures the following registry keys:

                            This script enhances privacy by limiting what search information is shared with Bing [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].

                            By default, Search in Windows shares user information, including search history, Microsoft account details, and location data,
                            to personalize search results and other Microsoft services [1] [2].
                            Executing this script ensures that search history, account details, or specific location data are not sent to Microsoft [1] [2].

                            Applicable to Windows 8.1 and later [1] [2] [3] [5], this script is a key privacy measure.
                            It is recommended by the US Department of Defense (DoD) and is considered a standard security practice [3].
                            Sharing this information is recognized as a security vulnerability [4].
                            The Center for Internet Security (CIS) also recommends this setting in its security framework [5].

                            The script modifies the following registry key to enforce this privacy setting:
                            `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Search!ConnectedSearchPrivacy` [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].

                            This script disables the integration of personal cloud content in the taskbar search box [1] [2] [3].

                            By default [2], Windows Search can access and display results from various Microsoft cloud services,
                            including OneDrive, Outlook, Bing, SharePoint [2] [3] [4] for both personal Microsoft accounts and
                            work or school accounts [1] [2] [3] [4].

                            This means your personal and work-related files stored on Microsoft's cloud platforms can be searched
                            through the Windows Search interface. While this feature increases convenience, it also poses privacy
                            concerns. For instance, someone with access to your computer can potentially view your personal search
                            results or data from your cloud storage. Additionally, your search queries are shared with Microsoft,
                            further impacting your privacy.

                            By disabling this feature, you ensure that Windows Search only returns results from your local device,
                            safeguarding your personal and professional information stored in cloud services. This action enhances
                            privacy by keeping your cloud-stored data separate from local search operations.

                            The script modifies two registry keys to disable cloud content search for different account types:

                            - For personal Microsoft accounts:
                              `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SearchSettings!IsMSACloudSearchEnabled` [1] [2] [3]
                            - For work or school accounts:
                              `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SearchSettings!IsAADCloudSearchEnabled` [1] [2] [3]

                                    The script disables the Windows Spotlight feature. Windows Spotlight is a feature in Windows 10 and Windows 11 [1] that automatically downloads
                                    and displays random wallpapers on the lock screen [1] [2]. These images are sourced from the internet [1] [2] [3]. At times, it might also promote
                                    various Microsoft products, services [1] [2], or even third-party apps and content [4].

                                    When the lock screen fetches images from the internet, there's a silent data exchange happening. This can inadvertently reveal details about the
                                    user's device or their preferences.

                                    To mitigate this potential privacy risk, the script makes a change to a key (`DisableWindowsSpotlightFeatures`) in the Windows operating system [3].
                                    Originally, Windows Spotlight is turned on unless the user decides otherwise [2].
                                    By applying this script, users can be sure their lock screen remains private and doesn't retrieve wallpapers from the internet, eliminating potential
                                    data leaks.

                            `VSCEIP` collects information about errors, computer hardware, and how people use Visual Studio [1].
                            The information is sent to Microsoft servers for further analysis.

                            This was previously known as Customer Experience Improvement Program (`PerfWatson`) for Visual Studio
                            that primarily collected your personal usage and related performance data [2].

                            For more information about the information collected, processed, or transmitted by the `VSCEIP`, see the
                            [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://web.archive.org/web/20231006103250/https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement).

                            Visual Studio uses different keys based on CPU architecture of the host operating system (32bit or 64bit) [1]:

                            - 32bit: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VSCommon`
                            - 64bit: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\VSCommon`

                            Key `OptIn` can have two different values [1]:

                            - `0` is opted out (turn off)
                            - `1` is opted in (turn on)

                            The default installation sets the key as `1` (opt-in by default) since Visual Studio 2022.

                            Feedback tool in Visual Studio allows users to report a problem from either Visual Studio or its installer.
                            It collects rich diagnostic information along with personally identifiable information [1]. Information includes large log files,
                            crash information, screenshots, repro recording, and other artifacts [1].

                            This script disables feedback dialog and screenshot capture/email input that's prompted to be sent as part of the feedback.

                            By default (after clean installation) the registry keys are not configured/set since Visual Studio 2022. Having these settings no
                            set imply that feedback is enabled.

                            Visual Studio Standard Collector Service is a service that is part of
                            [Microsoft Visual Studio and .NET Log Collection Tool](https://web.archive.org/web/20231207105404/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=12493) [1].
                            This service collects logs for Diagnostics Hub just like Diagnostic Hub Standard Collector [2].
                            It has been known to be vulnerable to privilege elavation [3] [4].

                            Disabling this service is recommended because otherwise it would:
                            - Increase the attack surface of your computer, making it open to potential future vulnerabilities.
                            - Use computer resources in favor of collecting more data about you and your behavior.

                            This script prevents IntelliCode in Visual Studio from collecting data.
                            IntelliCode uses AI to suggest code improvements by analyzing usage and error reports [1].
                            In scenarios like team model training, user code is shared with Microsoft [2] [3] [4].
                            Opting out does not affect IntelliCode's local suggestion capabilities [3] [4].

                            By relying on local data models [3] [4], this script improves privacy, reducing the amount of data shared with Microsoft.
                            The script works by modifying registry keys to disable the feature that sends data to Microsoft for remote analysis [3].
                            By default, Visual Studio 2022 and newer versions do not contain these registry keys.

                            The backend servers for IntelliCode model training are discontinued, making the data collection feature outdated [5].
                            Thus, this script provides peace of mind for users of older Visual Studio 2022 versions, even though the feature is outdated.

                            This category contains scripts that disable Nvidia telemetry tasks. Telemetry tasks are programmed to transmit data, which
                            may encompass system performance details or error reports [1] [2]. By disabling these tasks, you can improve your privacy by ensuring
                            your system's data remains confidential and is not shared with external sources.

                            This script disables the scheduled tasks associated with the Office telemetry agent.

                            The Office Telemetry Agent, introduced in Office 2013, collects and uploads a variety of data for monitoring purposes [1].
                            This data includes runtime logs, properties of Office documents, and other insights from Office applications [1] [2].
                            Notably, it can upload file names, paths, and document titles in their original format [1].
                            The data is stored locally before being uploaded to a shared folder (at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Telemetry`) [3].
                            This poses privacy risks as it may contain personal or confidential information.

                            The `OfficeTelemetryAgentLogOn` scheduled task, collects data for the Office Telemetry Dashboard [1]. This task activates upon
                            user login to an Office client and continues to scan and collect data during the session [1]. The types of data collected encompass
                            file names of recently accessed Office documents [2] [3], names of add-ins and solutions interacting with Office [3], and system information
                            including user and computer names [2]. 

                            Disabling these tasks is recommended for enhancing privacy. The script effectively prevents privacy risks associated with telemetry
                            data collection by disabling the related scheduled tasks. It prevents the collection and upload of potentially sensitive information,
                            thereby protecting users from exposure of personal or internal process-related details.

                            This script disables the "Microsoft Office Subscription Heartbeat" scheduled task. 

                            The primary function of the Office Subscription Heartbeat task is to periodically check the subscription status of Microsoft Office products [1] [2],
                            verifying their licenses are active and valid [1]. This task actively communicates with Microsoft servers, transmitting Microsoft account data [3] for
                            license verification.

                            Disabling this task improves privacy as it prevents these regular communications and data transmissions, though it may lead to complications
                            regarding license compliance over time.

                            The task creates and utilizes cache files located at `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\vfs\Common AppData\microsoft\office\Heartbeat` [1]
                            and `%PROGRAMDATA%\Microsoft\Office\Heartbeat\HeartbeatCache` [3] [4], in `HeartbeatCache.xml` file [1] [4]. It executes the `OLicenseHeartbeat.exe` process
                            daily [2], also known as "Office Subscription Licensing Heartbeat" [2].

                            `\Microsoft\Office\Office 15 Subscription Heartbeat` (tested since Office version 2208):

                            | OS Version       | Default Status       |
                            | ---------------- | -------------------- |
                            | Windows 10 22H2  | 🟡 N/A (missing)     |
                            | Windows 11 22H2  | 🟡 N/A (missing)     |

                            > **Caution:** Consider that while disabling this task may lead to increased privacy, it could also impact license compliance and the overall functionality
                            of Microsoft Office products in the long run.

                                    This script blocks the execution of the Chrome Software Reporter Tool, enhancing your privacy by preventing
                                    unnecessary data transmissions to Google, and boosting system performance through reduced resource consumption.

                                    This tool is also known as the *Software Reporter Tool* [1] [2] [3], *Software Reporter Tool for Chrome Cleanup* [4],
                                    *Chrome Cleanup Tool* [2] [3] and *Software Removal Tool* [2].
                                    It exists in Google Chrome [1] versions prior to v111 [3].
                                    Newer versions of Google Chrome do not include this tool [3].

                                    This tool scans for harmful software that may disrupt Chrome's operations [1] [3] [5] [6].
                                    It automatically removes software that degrades your browsing experience [1] [3] [5] [6].
                                    It can connect to the Internet, monitor applications, record keyboard and mouse inputs, and manipulate other programs [2].
                                    It reports findings to Google [1] [3] [4], which raises privacy concerns due to potential data collection and online reporting.

                                    The Software Reporter Tool may also significantly consume CPU and memory resources [1] [3] [4] [5], potentially leading to performance issues.
                                    By disabling it, you reduce CPU and memory usage, potentially speeding up your computer.

                                    It is located in the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\SwReporter` directory [1] [2] [3] [5].
                                    Its executable name is `software_reporter_tool.exe` [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6].
                                    This file reappears with each update of Chrome [3].
                                    Instead of deleting or moving the file, the script blocks its execution to ensure it remains disabled after Chrome updates.

                                    Disabling this tool protects your privacy by:

                                    - Preventing sending scan results to Google [1] [3] [4].
                                    - Some malware disguise themselves as `software_reporter_tool.exe` [2] so running this script will also protect you against these.
                                    - This outdated component [3] may contain known vulnerabilities; disabling it helps mitigate these security risks by reducing your attack surface.

                                    > **Caution**: Disabling this component may limit Chrome's ability to automatically detect and remove problematic software.

                                    This script disables the Firefox *Default Browser Agent*.
                                    The agent collects and sends information about the user's default browser to Mozilla [1]
                                    Disabling it halts the transmission of details such as the currently set default browser, the previous one,
                                    and the operating system's locale and version number [2] [3].

                                    This enhances privacy by preventing browser preferences and usage data from being shared with Mozilla.

                                    The script configures `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox!DisableDefaultBrowserAgent` registry key to
                                    prevent the Default Browser Agent from taking any actions [4].

                category: Disable Google background automatic updates
                docs: |-
                    This category includes scripts to manage the automatic updates of various Google products in background.
                    These products include Google Chrome, Google Earth, along with other applications [1].

                    This category aims to give users control over the automatic update processes running in the background,
                    without disabling manual updates or affecting the overall functionality of Google products [1].

                    Google Chrome checks for, downloads, and installs updates in the background [2], without requiring user interaction [2].
                    This includes constant network communication in background with Google servers, which reveals data about your device
                    and usage behavior.

                    By using the scripts provided, users can stop automatic update services and scheduled tasks related to Google software updates.
                    This empowers users to initiate updates at their discretion, ensuring they have the final say in what gets installed on their systems.

                            This script disables the "Google Update Service" services
                            These services are identified as `gupdate` and `gupdatem` [1] [2] [3].
                            They are responsible for keeping Google software up to date by initiating updates [4].
                            They are linked to the `GoogleUpdate.exe` executable located in the `%PROGRAMFILES%\Google\Update` directory [5] [6] [7].

                            The services operate based on a client/service model, where the client requests services to conduct updates [1].
                            Despite both services being named "Google Update Service" [3] [8] [9], they are associated with different aspects of updating.
                            The `gupdate` service is linked to regular update check [2] [5] [7], while `gupdatem` is connected to medium level service updates [2] [5] [6].

                            According to Google's documentation, these services play a crucial role in maintaining the software's security and functionality [3].
                            These services will uninstall themselves if no Google software is utilizing them [3].

                            However, there are privacy and security concerns associated with these services. They continuously run in the background, sending data back to Google [10] [11],
                            and they log Event Logs [12] [13] [14] [15] [16], which reveals information about the system's state. There have also been vulnerabilities found in these services
                            in the past, adding an additional layer of risk [17].

                            Disabling these services do not affect manual updates as these services are started for manual updates automatically [4].

                            Often administrators choose to delete these services to prevent auto-updates [9], a practice that is acknowledged by the Google team [9].
                            By disabling these services, this script aims to give users more control over their system and mitigate potential privacy and security risks, albeit at the cost
                            of not receiving automatic software updates from Google.

                            This script disables the scheduled tasks used by Google to automatically update its software on Windows.

                            The Google Update service creates two main tasks [1]:

                            - `GoogleUpdateTaskMachineCore`: Initiates automatic updates [2].
                            - `GoogleUpdateTaskMachineUA`: Corresponds to "Updates app" [3].

                            In newer versions of the Google Update service, these task names have random suffixes appended to them [4].

                            Both of these tasks call the executable file `C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Update\GoogleUpdate.exe` [5] [6].
                            This process is officially named as "Google Installer" [7] or "Constant Shell" [8].
                            It is responsible for handling updates [9] [10].

                            Disabling these tasks can impact the functionality of the "Google Credential Provider for Windows" (GCPW) service [11] [12].
                            GCPW is a tool used to manage devices with Google endpoint management [13].
                            This tool is typically used to offer access to Google Workspace services on managed computers [13].
                            It allows users to sign in to a Windows 10 or 11 device using their Google Account for work or school [14].

                            These tasks are described by Google as following [15]:

                            > Keeps your Google software up to date. If this task is disabled or stopped, your Google software will not be kept up to date, meaning security
                            > vulnerabilities that may arise cannot be fixed and features may not work. This task uninstalls itself when there is no Google software using it.

                docs: |-
                    This category includes scripts designed to disable Adobe's background automatic update services and tasks.
                    These automatic updates run in the background [1], typically starting up with your PC, and work to keep your Adobe software up to date [1].
                    By disabling them, you optimize your system's performance, reduce unwanted data collection, and minimize your vulnerability surface.
                    These scripts only disable automatic updates; manual updates are still possible.

                            Its primary function is to keep your Adobe software up to date [1].
                            Disabling this service can help optimize your system's performance and reduce unwanted data collection.

                            It manages the privileges required for various actions, such as installing app updates and syncing fonts [3].
                            This allows Adobe to perform its actions without prompting you for your system password or approval [3].

                            This service has had vulnerabilities in the past, including the Privilege Escalation Unquoted Service Path
                            vulnerability [4], making it a potential security risk.

                            The service's executable is typically found at
                            `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe Desktop Common\ElevationManager\AdobeUpdateService.exe` [1] [2].

                    This category focuses on disabling continuous background processes related to automatic updates of Dropbox. Although these processes are
                    intended to keep Dropbox up to date, they can be intrusive and use system resources unnecessarily. Disabling them does not prevent updates,
                    but stops the automatic background processes that are running constantly, contributing to both privacy and system optimization. Users have
                    to manually update Dropbox to ensure they have the latest version and security features.

                            Dropbox operates using two Windows services, `dbupdate` and `dbupdatem`, to manage automatic updates [1].

                                    This script improves your security by setting the `Diffie-Hellman` [1] [2] [3] key exchange
                                    to a minimum of 2048 bits.
                                    This is a secure way to exchange keys over public networks.

                                    The *SSL/TLS handshake* is a key part of establishing a secure connection over the internet.
                                    By disabling this weak algorithm, the script improves the security of the connection.

                                    By default, modern Windows versions use a 2048-bit size for Diffie-Hellman key exchanges [1].
                                    Sizes under 1024 bits are considered weak [4] [5].
                                    NIST in USA [4] and Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) in Germany [3] disallows usage of sizes
                                    under 2048 bits.
                                    NSA (National Security Agency) recommends at least 3072 bits [6].

                                    This script improves your security by enforcing a minimum of 2048 bits for RSA encryption keys (`PKCS` [1] [2]).
                                    RSA encryption keys play a crucial role in securing communications over the internet.
                                    The Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) define how to use RSA keys for secure communication encryption.
                                    Using keys that are too weak can expose your data to unauthorized access.

                                    This script only affects the *SSL/TLS handshake* process.
                                    The *SSL/TLS handshake* is a key part of establishing a secure connection over the internet.
                                    By disabling this weak algorithm, the script improves the security of the connection.

                                    From Windows 10, version 1507, and Windows Server 2016 onwards, the default RSA key size is 1024 bits [2].
                                    However, this script raises the client-side minimum to 2048 bits, aligning with modern security standards.
                                    Server-side RSA key strength relies on the server certificate [2].

                                    Since 2013, internet standards and regulatory bodies have banned 1024-bit RSA keys due to security vulnerabilities [3].
                                    These entities, including the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) in Germany [2] and the National Institute of Standards
                                    and Technology (NIST) in the USA [4] [5], now recommend the use of keys that are 2048 bits or longer.
                                    RSA key exchanges of 2048 bits or are widely accepted.

                                    In 2012, Microsoft deprecated 1024-bit RSA keys for their applications [5] [6] and will end support for them in
                                    Windows by March 2024 [3].

                                    While 2048-bit keys balances security with efficiency [7], a shift towards stronger 4096-bit RSA keys is emerging.
                                    Projects like Debian [8], Fedora [9], and CaCert.org [10] use larger keys for long-term tasks.

                                    However, this script disrupts connections to Hyper-V virtual machines, which still require 1024-bit keys [11].
                                    It does not affect other virtual environments such as Docker, WSL, or Windows Sandbox [11].

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > - The script prevents access to Hyper-V VMs.
                                    > - Using bigger keys increases security but may not work with some old or less secure apps.
                                    > - This can make your device slower and drain the battery faster.

                                    This category improves network security by disabling outdated and less secure cipher suites.

                                    **Cipher suites** are sets of cryptographic algorithms used to secure network connections [1].
                                    They include **ciphers**, known as **bulk encryption algorithms** [1] or simply **bulk ciphers** [2].
                                    Ciphers encrypt messages exchanged between clients and servers [1].
                                    Using outdated cipher suites exposes data to risks of interception and tampering during transmission [2].

                                    Disabling insecure ciphers meets security standards set by NIST [3], CIS [4], IRS [5], OWASP [6]
                                    and Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) [7].
                                    This enhances data confidentiality and integrity [4].
                                    It also protects against threats such as attackers exploiting cryptographic weaknesses, malicious insiders,
                                    state actors, and cybercriminals [8].

                                            This script disables RC2 ciphers.

                                            This script only affects the *SSL/TLS handshake* process.
                                            The *SSL/TLS handshake* is a key part of establishing a secure connection over the internet.
                                            By disabling this weak algorithm, the script improves the security of the connection.

                                            Authorities like Microsoft [1] [2] [3], NIST (FIPS) [4], CIS [5], Federal Office for Information Security

                                            classify this algorithm as weak and recommend against its use.

                                            By disabling RC2, the script enhances network security and data integrity [5], as these ciphers are
                                            susceptible to cryptographic attacks.

                                            This script disables these cipher algorithms:

                                            This script only affects the *SSL/TLS handshake* process.
                                            The *SSL/TLS handshake* is a key part of establishing a secure connection over the internet.
                                            By disabling this weak algorithm, the script improves the security of the connection.

                                            This algorithm provides no encryption [1] [5], leaving data completely unprotected.

                                            Authorities like Microsoft [2], NIST (FIPS) [1], CIS [3], and Federal Office for

                                            classify this algorithm as weak and recommend against its use.

                                            This cipher is disabled by default [1].

                                            Disabling these ciphers ensures that no data is transmitted in plaintext, which is crucial for
                                            maintaining data confidentiality and integrity [3].

                                            Disabling this algorithm will disallow the following cipher suites:

                                            - `TLS_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA` [2]
                                            - `TLS_RSA_WITH_NULL_SHA256` [2]

                                            > **Caution:** This may cause compatibility issues with older devices or software.

                                    This category includes scripts to disable insecure hash algorithms during cryptographic operations.

                                    Hash algorithms are essential for internet security, electronic banking, and document signing.
                                    Insecure hashes, however, are susceptible to collision attacks [1] [2].
                                    This vulnerability enables attackers to spoof content, perform phishing, or execute man-in-the-middle attacks [3] [4].
                                    Consequently, an attacker could intercept or modify data transmitted over what is believed to be a secure connection, without being detected.
                                    For instance, attackers could exploit this to divert your payments to their accounts, creating significant risks.

                                            This script disables `SHA` [1] [2] [3] hash algorithm, also known as *Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1)* [2].

                                            This script only affects the *SSL/TLS handshake* process.
                                            The *SSL/TLS handshake* is a key part of establishing a secure connection over the internet.
                                            By disabling this weak algorithm, the script improves the security of the connection.

                                            This algorithm is vulnerable to collision attacks [4] [5] [6] [7].
                                            This vulnerability enables attackers to spoof content, perform phishing, or execute man-in-the-middle attacks [8].
                                            Consequently, an attacker could intercept or modify data transmitted over what is believed to be a secure connection, without being detected.
                                            For instance, attackers could exploit this to divert your payments to their accounts, creating significant risks.

                                            Authorities like NIST (FIPS) [2], Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) [3], Mozilla [5], Microsoft [8],
                                            Google [4] [9] [10], OWASP [11], Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) [12], and Apple [13]
                                            classify this algorithm as weak and recommend against its use.

                                            Disabling this algorithm disallows the following cipher suites:

                                    This script enhances your security by reducing risks associated with secure communications.
                                    By running this script, you proactively enhance your online privacy and secure against
                                    well-known TLS vulnerabilities.

                                    TLS secures internet communications.
                                    It allows parties such as browsers and websites to update their encryption settings through **renegotiation** [2].
                                    Without safeguards, attackers could intercept and compromise these
                                    communications [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6].

                                    Insecure renegotiation can let attackers hijack communications from the start, enabling
                                    unauthorized control [1],
                                    data manipulation [3] [6],
                                    DoS attacks [3],
                                    and identity spoofing [4] [5] [6].

                                    To counter these threats, this script implements measures standardized in RFC 5746 [1] [2], effectively
                                    closing the loophole that allowed these vulnerabilities.

                                    This script enhances security by blocking insecure renegotiation attempts and
                                    aims to improve compatibility with older software.
                                    It modifies the following system settings to achieve this:

                                    This script may impact the functionality of software using outdated and insecure communication methods [3].
                                    Affected software includes older versions of:

                                    This category focuses on enhancing user privacy by disabling legacy and insecure communication
                                    protocols.
                                    It targets protocols that expose users to security vulnerabilities due to their outdated nature.

                                    Retaining obsolete protocols creates a false sense of security because they may seem secure but are
                                    vulnerable to exploitation [1].

                                    Authorities like NIST [1] (FIPS [2]), NSA (National Security Agency) [1],
                                    Office of the Chief Information Security Officer [2], Microsoft [3], Mozilla [4],
                                    PCI Security Standards Council [5], the Center for Internet Security [6],
                                    and IETF [9]
                                    recommend disabling insecure and obsolete protocols.

                                    Most modern operating systems [3] and browsers [4] disable these protocols by default.
                                    However, certain protocols remain active on some Windows systems [3] [7], posing security risks.
                                    It is crucial to disable these protocols to mitigate risks from well-known attacks such as
                                    POODLE [5] and BEAST [5].

                                    This category excludes the following protocols:

                                    - **DTLS 1.1**:
                                    DTLS 1.1 does not exist [8] [9];
                                    its numbering was skipped to align with TLS versioning [8].
                                    - **TLS 1.2**, and **DTLS 1.2** (based on TLS 1.2 [8]):
                                    TLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.2 are enabled by default on Windows [7] and are approved by authorities like
                                    NIST [2], and German Federal Office for Information Security [10].
                                    Disabling them could affect application functionality, and earlier versions are not
                                    widely supported by Windows [7] [10].

                                            This script improves network security by disabling the outdated SMBv1 protocol.

                                            **SMBv1**, or **Server Message Block version 1**, is an outdated network protocol developed
                                            for file and printer sharing across networks [1] [2].
                                            This protocol is well-known for its vulnerabilities to cyber attacks [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].
                                            Microsoft deprecated SMBv1 in 2014 [6] [7].
                                            Since 2007, newer and more secure versions of this protocol have
                                            replaced SMBv1 in modern versions of Windows [6].
                                            It is still enabled by default in older Windows versions [1].
                                            Microsoft advises disabling this protocol to strengthen security [1] [8].
                                            SMB1 is not necessary for most users, as Microsoft ensures vendor support for at least SMB 2.0 [2].

                                            The primary reasons for disabling SMBv1 include:

                                            - It uses the outdated MD5 hash algorithm, vulnerable to security attacks [3].
                                            - It fails to meet modern security standards set by FIPS [3], CISA (US-CERT) [5],
                                            CIS (Department of Defense) [3], and Microsoft Security Baseline [8].
                                            - It lacks the efficiency and performance improvements present in newer versions of the protocol [2].
                                            - It is vulnerable to various cyber threats [1] [2] [3] [4] [5],
                                            , including ransomware and malware [1] [2].

                                            Disabling SMBv1 may lead to compatibility issues with older network devices and software [1] [3] [6] [9].
                                            This may affect file sharing and print services on systems like Windows Server 2003 [3]
                                            and some older Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices [3].
                                            These systems are insecure and are no longer supported.

                                            This script makes the following changes to your system:

                                            - Removal of SMBv1 components:
                                            - `SMB1Protocol` [2] [3] [4] [10] (also known as `FS-SMB1` [2] [11])
                                            - `SMB1Protocol-Client` [10]
                                            - `SMB1Protocol-Server` [10].
                                            - Disabling the `mrxsmb10` (SMB 1.x MiniRedirector [12]) driver,
                                            linked with SMBv1 [1] [4] [13],
                                            and adjusting related settings to keep older systems stable [1] [4] [13].
                                            - Disabling server side processing of SMBv1 protocol using
                                            `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters!SMBv1` registry key [1] [14] [15].

                                            These changes require a system reboot to take effect [1] [4] [9].

                                            This script enhances your network's security by turning off NetBIOS over TCP/IP for all network interfaces.

                                            NetBIOS is a protocol primarily used for backward compatibility with older Windows systems [1] [2].
                                            NetBIOS and LLMNR are susceptible to hacking techniques like spoofing [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] and man-in-the-middle
                                            attacks [1] [2] [6], risking your credentials and unauthorized network access [2] [5] [6].

                                            NetBIOS was initially created for communication between applications in small networks [1] [3] [5] [7].
                                            Its lack of authentication makes it easy for attackers to redirect traffic or fake network services [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6].

                                            Disabling NetBIOS helps protect against these security risks and reduces the exposure of Windows-specific services
                                            to potential attackers.

                                            The script disables NetBIOS by changing a specific registry values
                                            (`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\NetBT\Parameters\Interfaces\{Interface}!NetbiosOptions` [1] [8]) from their default
                                            of `0` (enabled) [5] to `2` (disabled) [5] [8] for each network interface.

                                            > **Caution:** This may cause compatibility issues with older devices or software.

                                            This script disables the SSL 2.0 protocol.
                                            This protocol is identified as `SSL 2.0` on Windows [1] [2] [3],
                                            and also known as *SSL2* [4] [5].

                                            Modern Windows systems no longer include SSL 2.0 due to its security flaws [2] [4].
                                            It was previously enabled by default [4],
                                            posing significant security risks from well-known vulnerabilities [5].

                                            Authorities like NIST (FIPS) [6], NSA (National Security Agency) [7],

                                            and Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) [3]
                                            recommend disabling this insecure and obsolete protocol.

                                            This protocol is identified as `TLS 1.1` on Windows [1] [2] [3].

                                            Although deprecated and unsupported in newer Windows versions [4],
                                            it remains enabled by default in older versions [5].
                                            This protocol contains fundamental well-documented security vulnerabilities [6].

                                            Major browsers [7], including Safari [8], Firefox [9], Chrome [10] and Edge [11],
                                            now disable this protocol by default.

                                            Authorities like NIST (FIPS) [12], IETF [6] [9], NSA (National Security Agency) [12] [13],

                                            recommend disabling this insecure and obsolete protocol.

                                            While disabling TLS 1.1 improves security, it may disrupt certain older applications that
                                            depend on this protocol [4] [12].

                                            DTLS (*Datagram Transport Layer Security*) provides secure communication over the UDP protocol [3].
                                            Based on the TLS protocol, DTLS offers equivalent security measures [3].
                                            Common uses include online gaming, DNS lookups, and VPN services.

                                            It is considered insecure [4] [5] and has been deprecated by Microsoft due to its vulnerabilities [6].

                                    By setting the `SchUseStrongCrypto` configuration [1] [2] [3] [4], it prevents the use of outdated
                                    and insecure connections, including:

                                    - Protocols weaker than TLS 1.1 [1] [4] and TLS 1.2 [1] [2] [4].
                                    - Cipher algorithms such as RC4 [4] [5], NULL [6], DES [6], and export suites [6].
                                    - Hash algorithms like MD5 [6].

                                    Authorities like Microsoft [1], and Department of Defense (DoD) [3]
                                    recommend this configuration as part of their security guidelines.

                                    A ***.NET application*** is any software developed using Microsoft's .NET platform [7].
                                    This includes many third-party and system applications on Windows, like PowerShell [8].
                                    A .NET application can be various of types, ranging from mobile apps to cloud services [7].

                                    This script affects only the client-side (outgoing) connections of an application [1].
                                    It secures outgoing data from the application without changing how incoming data is handled.

                                    You must restart your system after running this script to activate the security improvements [2] [5].

                                    This script enables the DTLS 1.2 protocol.
                                    This protocol is identified as `DTLS 1.2` on Windows [1] [2].

                                    DTLS (*Datagram Transport Layer Security*) provides secure communication over the UDP protocol [3].
                                    Based on the TLS protocol, DTLS offers equivalent security measures [3].
                                    Common uses include online gaming, DNS lookups, and VPN services.

                                    Despite being superseded by the more secure DTLS 1.3 [4],
                                    DTLS 1.2 is still approved by authorities like NIST [5], NSA [6],
                                    and the German Federal Office for Information Security [2].

                                    DTLS 1.2 is based on TLS 1.2 [7].
                                    It's supported by Windows since Windows 10 version 1607 and by Windows Server 2016 Standard [8] [9].
                                    privacy.sexy chooses DTLS 1.2 over DTLS 1.3 due to the lack of support for DTLS 1.3 on Windows platforms [8].

                                    This script only works on Windows 10 version 1607 or newer.
                                    This restriction is in place to maintain system stability
                                    by allowing only supported Windows versions to use the protocol.

                                    This script provides secure connections for older .NET Framework applications.

                                    It enables the automatic adoption of newer, more secure protocols as supported by the operating system [1].
                                    If the operating system supports newer TLS versions, applications will automatically use these without
                                    any need for modifications to the application code or .NET Framework settings [1] [2] [3].
                                    For example, this configuration enables .NET Framework 3.5 applications, which do not natively support
                                    TLS 1.2, to adopt TLS 1.2 [2].

                                    This script applies to all .NET applications on the system [1].
                                    A ***.NET application*** is any software developed using Microsoft's .NET platform [4].
                                    This includes many third-party and system applications on Windows, like PowerShell [5].
                                    A .NET application can be various of types, ranging from mobile apps to cloud services [4].

                                    This script modifies the `SystemDefaultTlsVersions` configuration [1] [2] [3] [6] [7].
                                    This setting enables the operating system to automatically select the most secure available protocol for
                                    .NET applications [1].
                                    Thus, applications automatically benefit from future security enhancements and new protocols added to the
                                    operating system, without the need for updates [1].
                                    This maintains ongoing security as new TLS versions emerge and older ones are retired [1].
                                    It may also resolve compatibility issues with older devices or software [7].
                                    However, it may also result in compatibility issues if the system defaults are too restrictive [8].

                            This category improves security by disabling insecure remote administration features.
                            Organizations use remote administration tools to manage multiple systems from a central location,
                            performing tasks such as software updates, system checks, and configuration changes.

                            However, if not properly secured, unauthorized users could exploit these tools to access sensitive data
                            or control systems.
                            This category addresses such vulnerabilities by disabling outdated or insecure remote access methods,
                            thus securing systems against potential cyber threats.

                            While these measures maintain information confidentiality and integrity, they may restrict some remote
                            management functionalities.

                                    This script configures the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) client to disable **basic authentication** [1] [2].
                                    Basic authentication is a security protocol where a user provides a username and password in plain text for verification [3].
                                    It improves security by preventing the interception and misuse of plain text passwords [1].

                                    It achieves this by modifying the `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Client!AllowBasic`
                                    registry key [1] [2].

                                    While WinRM clients do not use Basic authentication by default [2], this script ensures that this less
                                    secure method remains disabled.

                                    This script increases your system's security by preventing unauthorized users from seeing account names in the
                                    Security Accounts Manager (SAM) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6].
                                    The Security Accounts Manager (SAM) is a database in Windows that stores user account information and
                                    is critical for user authentication processes.
                                    When account names are exposed, attackers might use them for guessing passwords or tricking people into revealing
                                    sensitive information [4] [6] [7] [8].
                                    This is a security action recommended by organizations like the Department of Defense [1], NASA [2], IRS [8],
                                    NIST [6], CIS [4], and Microsoft [3].

                                    The change is enacted through the `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa!RestrictAnonymousSAM` registry
                                    value [1] [2] [4] [5]. By default, it's enabled [4] and Windows restricts this setting if the registry value does
                                    not exist [3].

                                    While the script protects against these threats, it may also affect compatibility with older systems.
                                    It prevents trust with Windows NT 4.0 domains [4] [5] [7] [9] and causes issues for older systems such as Windows NT 3.51
                                    and Windows 95 when accessing server resources [4] [5] [7].
                                    Typically, anonymous connections are requested by earlier versions of clients (down-level clients) during SMB session setup [7].

                                    The script has no impact on domain controllers since their behavior in this aspect is controlled by different settings [5] [7].
                                    The policy setting does not require a restart to become effective [5], and there is no impact on current systems
                                    where the default behavior already includes this restriction [4].

                                    Despite the potential interoperability issues with older systems, the script maintains a security posture that is
                                    important in modern networks to minimize unauthorized access and protect user privacy.

                                    This script improves your privacy and security by disabling Windows administrative shares,
                                    which are typically used for remote access to your computer's file system.

                                    Windows automatically creates hidden administrative shares, such as `C$` and `D$`, that allow system administrators remote access to
                                    every disk volume on your computer [1] [2]. These shares are often targeted as potential attack vectors [3].

                                    Disabling administrative shares is generally a good practice for enhancing security. It is recommended by various security standards
                                    and compliance frameworks, including some government standards [3], PCI-DSS [4], and CIS [2]. It reduces the system's vulnerability
                                    to unauthorized remote access.

                                    These shares are often used for system administrators to perform tasks like software installation and vulnerability scanning
                                    remotely [1]. Disabling them may limit remote management capabilities. This might require setting up network shares manually
                                    for specific folders or drives, which is more secure but requires additional effort.

                                    Some software, such as Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) [2], Microsoft Operations Manager [2], Microsoft PsTools [5],
                                    and certain third-party network backup applications [2], rely on administrative shares. Therefore, disabling these shares could
                                    disrupt their functionality.

                                    This script disables the **Telnet Client** feature in Windows.

                                    The Telnet Client enables remote server connections [1].
                                    It is inherently insecure because it transmits all data, including sensitive credentials,
                                    in clear text without encryption [2] [3].
                                    This lack of encryption makes it vulnerable to interception and misuse [3].
                                    Due to these security flaws, entities such as NIST [2], Department of Defense [2]
                                    and Microsoft [1] recommend removing or disabling this feature.

                                    Although this feature is disabled by default in newer versions of Windows [1], ensuring
                                    that it remains disabled can prevent accidental or unauthorized use.

                                    This script removes the "RAS Connection Manager Administration Kit (CMAK)" (`RasCMAK.Client` [1]) capability.

                                    CMAK is a tool that allows the creation of profiles for connecting to remote servers and networks [1].

                                    Though useful for remote connections, this capability might be unnecessary for many users.
                                    Removing it can simplify the system's network configuration and enhance security by reducing potential attack vectors.

                                    This capability is not included in the standard installation of Windows [1].

                                    This script disables the Windows Remote Assistance feature to improve your system's privacy and security.
                                    Windows Remote Assistance allows a third party to remotely access your PC [1].
                                    This capability, known as *Solicited Remote Assistance* [2], enables another user to view or take
                                    control of your computer [2] [3] [4] [5].

                                    Disabling Remote Assistance improves security by:

                                    - Preventing others from remotely viewing or controlling your computer [2].
                                    - Reducing the risk of exploitation from RDP-related vulnerabilities [5].
                                    - Reducing the attack surface by eliminating unnecessary remote access functionalities.

                                    The script modifies the following settings to achieve this:

                                    - It configures `fAllowToGetHelp` to block users from requesting remote assistance [3].
                                    - It configures `fAllowFullControl` to prevent remote users from gaining full control of the system [4].

                                    These changes are applied via:

                                    - The application setting in the Windows registry at `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Remote Assistance` [6].
                                    - The Group Policy setting at `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services` [2].

                                    This script disables the "Net.TCP Port Sharing" feature.

                                    This feature is part of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) [1].

                                    This feature enables multiple WCF applications to share the same TCP port [1].
                                    It manages incoming connections and routes them to the appropriate application based on
                                    the destination address found in the message stream [1].

                                    This increases the system's attack surface [2]:

                                    - When applications share the same port, more applications are exposed to network traffic.
                                    - It runs under a system account with high permissions, making the system vulnerable to extensive
                                        access by attackers if compromised [2].
                                    - Poor application configuration can increase risk of serious damage if an application is compromised [1].
                                    - The security of the system depends significantly on how well each individual application handles security.

                                    It's disabled by default on Windows due to security concerns [1].

                                    SMB Direct improves file transfer speeds across networks by utilizing network adapters that are
                                    Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) capable [1].

                                    Although not inherently insecure [2], maintaining unnecessary software can increase the attack surface,
                                    especially if the underlying RDMA hardware has vulnerabilities.

                                    The TFTP Client supports file transfers using the *Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)*.
                                    TFTP protocol is insecure because it lacks authentication and encryption capabilities [1] [2] [3].
                                    This makes data transferred via TFTP vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering [2] [3].

                                    Although TFTP's simplicity can be advantageous in certain contexts, such as configuring network devices,
                                    its security risks generally outweigh these benefits.
                                    Disabling it helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized data access and simplifies system security management [1] [2].

                docs: |-
                    This category includes scripts that focus on disabling various aspects of clipboard data collection in Windows.
                    The clipboard is a critical component of the operating system, often containing sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, and other
                    personal information [1].
                    However, features such as clipboard history and device synchronization can significantly increase privacy and security risks.

                    By default, Windows tends to store clipboard data in an unencrypted format [2], making it easily accessible to malicious applications or scripts.
                    Additionally, data synchronization features can lead to sensitive information being stored on remote servers or shared across devices, increasing the
                    risk of data exposure.

                    The scripts in this category address these risks by disabling the related features..
                    While these features offer convenience and productivity benefits, they can inadvertently compromise user privacy and security.

                            Disabling Cloud Clipboard is recommended in secure environments where clipboard data should remain local to the system, avoiding
                            potential exposure or misuse of sensitive information [6]. The Center for Internet Security (CIS) recommends disabling this feature in

                            can improve privacy [1]. This script secures your clipboard data by preventing unauthorized access from other processes on your computer
                            or network, reducing the risk of data theft.

                            The script configures the following registry keys:

                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System!AllowCrossDeviceClipboard`: Disables the Cloud Clipboard feature, preventing
                            clipboard synchronization across devices [1] [2] [6].
                            - `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Clipboard!CloudClipboardAutomaticUpload`: Stops the automatic upload of clipboard data to the cloud [7].

                            > **Caution**: After running this script, clipboard contents will not synchronize across devices [1] [2] [6].
                            > Text or images copied on one device will not be accessible on other devices [3] [4] [5].
                            > This enhances privacy and security but limits the clipboard's functionality across your Windows devices.

                        docs: |-
                            This script deactivates the clipboard history feature in Windows, a feature that is enabled by default [1] [2].
                            Regularly, users copy sensitive data such as usernames and passwords to their clipboard, making clipboard history
                            valuable to attackers for gathering information for post-exploitation activities like lateral movement.

                            Microsoft introduced clipboard history in the Windows 10 October 2018 Update [1], offering enhanced functionality, including
                            multi-device sync and customizable history management [1].
                            Despite these benefits, clipboard history poses several security risks:

                            - **Plain Text Storage**: Clipboard data is stored unencrypted, making it vulnerable to access by malicious applications [3].
                            - **Persistent Memory**: The data remains in memory until overwritten or the machine restarts, exposing it to unauthorized access
                            by other users or malware [3].
                            - **Process Accessibility**: Most running processes and applications can access clipboard data, increasing the risk if any are malicious [3].
                            - **Open Network Threats**: Malicious website scripts could potentially access clipboard data, leading to data theft [3].
                            - **Windows Clipboard History**: Stores the last 25 copied text and image items, which could include sensitive information [3].
                            - **Increased Attack Surface**: Clipboard history is susceptible to exploitation by malware that silently accesses and logs clipboard data [3].

                            Microsoft's privacy statement also indicates that clipboard data could be used for marketing and advertising purposes [4].

                            Given these risks, especially when handling sensitive data like passwords or credit card numbers [5], it is advisable for
                            users concerned about security to disable clipboard history to safeguard their privacy.

                            This script modifies Windows Registry keys to turn off clipboard history and sync features:

                            - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Clipboard!EnableClipboardHistory`: Disables the local clipboard history for the current user [6] [7] [8].
                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System!AllowClipboardHistory`: Disables the policy for storing clipboard contents [2] [9].

                            This script disables `cbdhsvc` also known as "Clipboard User Service" [1].
                            This service is responsible for clipboard history and synchronization across devices [1].

                            Microsoft acknowledges that disabling this service does not adversely affect the system's core functionality [2].

                            Disabling this service enhances your security by reducing your system's
                            vulnerability surface. This service has been historically susceptible to vulnerabilities such as Privilege Escalation vulnerability [3].
                            Turning off `cbdhsvc` also helps improve system performance by reducing the number of background processes as `cbdhsvc` runs automatically
                            in the background [1].
                            Additionally, it enhances privacy by preventing the storage and sharing of clipboard history with Microsoft servers.
                            Clipboard data often contains sensitive information, including passwords and credit card numbers [4].
                            
                            > **Caution**: Disabling this service will remove the functionalities for clipboard history and synchronization across devices.
                            > If you depend on these features, you should weigh the benefits against the loss of these functionalities.

        category: Block tracking hosts
        docs: |-
            This category includes scripts that enhance privacy by blocking communications with hosts known for tracking
            and data collection.

            A **host** is a domain name serving as an address for a computer or resource on the Internet.
            These hosts are often used by software applications, operating systems, and services to collect data, which
            can include personal information, usage patterns, and more.

            By modifying the **hosts file** (a simple text file on your computer that maps domain names to IP addresses),
            these scripts stop your computer from connecting to servers that collect user data.

            This not only reduces personal data sent to companies and third-party trackers, enhancing privacy, but may also
            optimize system performance by minimizing unnecessary network requests.

            > **Caution**: These scripts may interfere with the functionality of apps or services relying on the blocked data.
            > Balance privacy with functionality according to your preferences and needs.

                docs: |-
                    This script prevents Windows from sending crash reports to Microsoft, enhancing your privacy.

                    Windows Error Reporting (WER) creates minidumps (small memory snapshots at crash time) and
                    sends them to Microsoft [1].
                    
                    Although intended to improve software by analyzing crash data, this feature raises privacy concerns
                    such as:

                    - Inclusion of sensitive information within the dumps, such as personal data and passwords [2] [3].
                    - Data sharing with Microsoft and other third parties through the Windows Desktop Application Program [1].

                    To safeguard your privacy, this script blocks specific hosts that Windows uses to transmit crash data,
                    ensuring these minidump files remain on your local machine and are not sent to Microsoft or its partners.

                    WER is designed to collect diagnostic information [1] and report it back to Microsoft [1] [6], aiming to improve

                    private.

                    This script improves privacy by blocking data sharing to the *Windows Connected User Experiences and

                    This component is responsible for collecting and transmitting diagnostic data and usage

                    product and service offerings [2].

                    While the collection of this data is intended to improve user experience by allowing Microsoft

                    keep their diagnostic information private.
                    Blocking these endpoints prevents the automatic transmission of this data to Microsoft [2],

                            - **Account Information**: Includes your name, email, phone number, payment details, and address shared during account
                            creation or when upgrading plans [2].
                            - **Your Files**: Covers data on files you save in Dropbox, their usage, and details [2].
                            - **Contacts**: If granted access, Dropbox stores contacts [2].
                            - **Usage Information**: Tracks how you use Dropbox services, including file management and electronic signature activities [2].
                            - **Device Information**: Includes information from your devices like IP addresses, browsers, location data [2].
                            - **User Settings**: Uses cookies and pixel tags to remember your settings [2].
                            - **DocSend and Dropbox Analytics**: Collects data, including device and ID information, when you view content via these services [2].

                            Spotify, known for being pre-installed with Windows [2], can collect data in the background without user consent.

                            This script stops the transmission of real-time data to the Spotify Live Tile [1], which may contain user-specific content or usage patterns.

                            **Live Tiles**, a feature within UWP apps, automatically collect and display updated information
                            directly on the Start menu, without opening the app [3].
                            The Live Tiles feature, once available on Windows 8.1 and 10 [4], has been replaced by the
                            **Widgets** feature in Windows 11 [5].

                            > **Caution**: Using this script may have side effects on Spotify functionalities beyond the Live Tile, potentially influencing other app
                            > features or the Spotify website experience [6].

                    This script improves user privacy by disabling the transmission of location data to Microsoft's servers [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].
                    Location data is utilized by various Windows applications [1] [2] [3] [4] [5], including the Camera app [6] [7],
                    to provide location-based services.

                    However, the collection of such data raises privacy concerns as it involves transmitting potentially sensitive information
                    such as OS version, device details, nearby wireless access points (including MAC addresses and signal strengths), and various
                    unique identifiers [6].

                    Sending this data to Microsoft allows for detailed profiling of your location and movements [6].
                    This has led to privacy lawsuits alleging unauthorized tracking of users without their consent, particularly
                    regarding the Camera app's location tracking capabilities [6] [7].

                    By blocking the specified hosts, this script prevents Windows apps from accessing and sending location data  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5],

                    This script blocks specific hosts associated with Cortana and Live Tiles,
                    thereby enhancing your preventing updates to Cortana's greetings, tips, and Live Tiles [1].

                    **Cortana** and **Live Tiles**, part of the Universal Windows Platform (UWP), enable voice-activated
                    app control and deliver timely information directly to users [2]:

                      directly on the Start menu, without opening the app [2].
                      The Live Tiles feature, once available on Windows 8.1 and 10 [3], has been replaced by the
                      **Widgets** feature in Windows 11 [4].
                    - **Cortana** is a voice-based interactive digital assistant on Windows devices [2].
                      Cortana listens to commands, activates the relevant app, passes the speech to/text commands to app [2].

                    > **Caution**:

                    The following hosts are excluded (not blocked):

                    - `r.bing.com` [1] [5]:
                      Blocking this host impacts several features, including Cortana [1] [5], Live Tiles [1] [5],
                      Copilot [6] [7] [8], and Bing Maps [9] [10] [11].
                    - `www.bing.com` [1] [5]:
                      Blocking this host prevents access to the Bing search engine and its associated tools [12],
                      impacting more than just Cortana and Live Tiles.

                docs: |-
                    This script blocks the connection between Microsoft Edge and the Experimentation and Configuration Service (ECS) [1].

                    ECS delivers various updates to Microsoft Edge, including configurations, feature rollouts, and experiments [1]:

                    - **Configurations** aim to ensure the product's health, security, and privacy compliance [1].
                      These settings are uniform for all users, based on their platforms and channels, and can enable or disable features
                      as necessary [1].
                    - **Controlled Feature Rollout (CFR)** gradually introduces a new feature to a portion of the user base [1].
                    - **Experiments** test new features and functionalities within Microsoft Edge that are still under development [1].
                      These features are not visible to all users and are activated or deactivated through experiment flags [1].

                    By blocking communication with ECS, this script prevents Microsoft Edge from receiving updates related to these payloads [1].
                    It enhances user privacy by limiting exposure to experimental features and configurations that may collect data or alter
                    the browsing experience without the user's explicit consent.

                docs: |-
                    This category offers scripts to disable Windows security components known as *Microsoft Defender*.
                    Although designed to protect you, these features may compromise your privacy and decrease computer performance.

                    Privacy concerns include:

                    - Sending personal data to Microsoft for analysis [1] [2] [3].
                    - The labeling of efforts to block telemetry (data collection by Microsoft) as security threats [4] [5].
                    - The incorrect flagging of privacy-enhancing scripts from privacy.sexy as malicious software [6].

                    Turning off Microsoft Defender improves your computer's speed by freeing up system resources [7].

                    However, disabling these features could result in:

                    - Potential program malfunctions [8], as these security features are integral to Windows [9].
                    - Lowered defenses against malware and other online threats.

                    These scripts target only the Defender features built into Windows and do not impact other Defender services available
                    with Microsoft 365 subscriptions [10] [11].

                    > **Caution**:
                    > These scripts **may reduce your security** and **cause issues with software** relying on them.
                    > Consider an alternative security solutions to maintain protection.

                            This category provides scripts to disable the Microsoft Defender Firewall.

                            This firewall serves as a security gate for your computer.
                            It controls network traffic to and from a computer [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].
                            It blocks all incoming traffic by default and allows outgoing traffic [1].
                            It enables users to block connections [1] [3] [5] [6] [7].
                            For enhanced security, users can require a VPN for all connections with IPSec rules [1] [3] [7].
                            This can protect your computer from unauthorized access [1] [4] [6] [8].

                            Microsoft has renamed the firewall several times to reflect branding changes:

                            1. **Internet Connection Firewall** initially [3].
                            2. **Windows Firewall** with the release of Windows XP Service Pack 2 [3].
                            3. **Windows Defender Firewall** starting with Windows 10 build 1709 (September 2017) [4] [5].
                            4. **Microsoft Defender Firewall** from Windows 10 version 2004 onwards [5] [6].
                            5. **Windows Firewall** again in 2023 [9].

                            Considerations:

                            - Malware or unauthorized users can bypass it if they gain direct access to the computer [10].
                            - Default firewall settings often provide limited security unless properly configured [10].
                              This is the case for most users.
                            - The firewall is enabled by default [1] [2] [4] [5].
                              It still operates in the background when turned off [7].
                              This can compromise privacy.
                            - Firewall logs detail user behavior [11].
                              They fall under [Microsoft's privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20231006103250/https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement).
                              This allows Microsoft to access and analyze these logs to study your behavior.

                            Turning off this firewall may optimize system performance by reducing background tasks [7].
                            It enhances privacy by preventing the collection of firewall logs [11].
                            However, this could increase security risks by exposing your system to more threats [1] [4] [6] [8].

                            > **Caution**:
                            > Turning off the Microsoft Defender Firewall **may reduce your security**.
                            > Consider an alternative security solution to maintain protection.

                                    Even with the firewall disabled in settings, its services and drivers continue running [1],
                                    potentially monitoring network traffic and consuming resources.
                                    These scripts directly disable these components, bypassing standard Windows settings and their limitations.

                                    Disabling these firewall services and drivers can enhance privacy by preventing potential network traffic monitoring by Microsoft.
                                    Additionally, it may improve system performance by freeing up system resources otherwise consumed by these components.

                                    However, this can pose security risks and disrupt other software.
                                    Microsoft Defender Firewall blocks unauthorized network access to protect against malicious attacks [2].
                                    Disabling it can leave your system vulnerable to such threats.
                                    Additionally, this could affect software relying on the firewall [1].

                                    > **Caution**: These scripts **may reduce your security** and **cause issues with software** relying on the firewall [1].

                                            This script disables the **Windows Defender Firewall Authorization Driver** service.

                                            This service is a kernel mode driver crucial for inspecting network traffic entering and exiting your computer [1] [2].

                                            Disabling this service can enhance privacy by reducing Microsoft's capability to monitor and analyze your network traffic.
                                            It also improves system performance by decreasing background resource consumption.

                                            The driver is identified by the file `mpsdrv.sys` [1] [2] [3].

                                            Disabling this driver disables **Windows Defender Firewall** [1] [2].
                                            This action can significantly increase security risks [6].

                                            This component acts as a gatekeeper for your computer, filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic based on
                                            established security rules [1] [5] to prevent unauthorized access [3] [4].

                                            This service runs the firewall component of Windows [4].
                                            It starts automatically [3] and runs the `%WINDIR%\System32\MPSSVC.dll` driver [3].
                                            This file is also referred to as **Microsoft Protection Service** [6].

                                            Beyond firewall functionality, it plays an important role in **Windows Service Hardening** to protect Windows services
                                            [7] [8]. It also enforces **network isolation** in virtualized environments [7] [9].

                                            Disabling this service can enhance privacy by reducing Microsoft's capability to monitor and analyze your network traffic.

                                            However, it may expose the system to substantial security threats [10].
                                            This risk is partly mitigated by boot-time filters that are triggered to protect the computer during startup or when the

                                    This script hides the "Firewall & network protection" section in the "Windows Security" interface. Previously, this interface was
                                    called "Windows Defender Security Center" [1].

                                    The "Firewall & network protection" section provides details about the device's firewalls and network connections [2]. It shows the status
                                    of both the Windows Defender Firewall and any other third-party firewalls [2]. However, after using this script, users will no longer see
                                    this section in the "Windows Security" interface [3].

                                    This script sets the `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender Security Center\Firewall and network protection!UILockdown" registry
                                    key to hide the Firewall and network protection area [3].

                                                    Starting from its version 5.39 in August 2016, MSRT was observed to transmit a "Heartbeat Report" to Microsoft every time it operated [2].
                                                    This happens even when the Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) is turned off, and even if "DiagTrack" is not installed on the
                                                    computer [2]. Such a report can be confirmed by viewing the MRT log located at `%windir%\debug\mrt.log` [2].

                                                    This script enhances user privacy by setting a specific system key, `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\MRT!DontReportInfectionInformation`,
                                                    to halt this data sharing with Microsoft [1] [2].

                                                    This script disables the scheduled scans by the Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) provided by Microsoft.

                                                    Starting from version 5.39 in August 2016, MSRT sends a "Heartbeat Report" to Microsoft every time it runs [1]. This behavior occurs even if certain user
                                                    preferences like the Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) are turned off or if "DiagTrack" is not on the computer [1]. A record of this "Successfully
                                                    Submitted Heartbeat Report" can be checked in the MRT log, found at `%windir%\debug\mrt.log` [1].

                                                    By using this script, users enhance their privacy by preventing such automatic data transmissions to Microsoft.

                                            This script removes the "Windows Security" icon from the system tray. "Windows Security" is an interface introduced in Windows 10, version 1703
                                            and was originally named "Windows Defender Security Center" [1].

                                            The icon in the system tray is controlled by the `SecurityHealthSystray.exe` file [2] [3].

                                            The script modifies the registry to stop this file from running on startup, effectively removing the icon. It specifically removes
                                            `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run!SecurityHealth`. This key exists in modern versions of Windows (tested since Windows 11 22H2
                                            and Windows 10 22H2) with default value of `%windir%\system32\SecurityHealthSystray.exe`.

                                        name: Disable Microsoft Defender Antimalware (AM) user interface
                                        docs: |-
                                            This script ensures that the Antimalware User Interface (AM UI) remains concealed from users [1], essentially
                                            preventing user interactions with the Microsoft Defender Antivirus interface.

                                            Several reasons to hide the antivirus interface:

                                            1. **Reduced data sharing**: Whether you're using Defender or disabling it for an alternative solution, minimizing
                                            its visible interactions can potentially limit the extent of user data shared with Microsoft. Many users feel more
                                            in control of their data when they aren't constantly reminded of a running security service.
                                            2. **Minimized Interruptions**: By hiding the interface, you can prevent users from starting and pausing scans.
                                            Eliminating the interface means users aren't prompted or nudged to make selections which might unknowingly share
                                            more data. This not only keeps the user experience neat but also minimizes accidental data sharing chances.
                                            3. **Reduced notifications**: With the headless UI mode enabled in Windows 10 (version 1703 and newer), Microsoft Defender
                                            Antivirus notifications are hidden, ensuring users aren't overwhelmed with security notifications [2]. This can contribute to
                                            a cleaner, less interrupted user experience. By reducing these notifications, the system lessens the chances of users inadvertently
                                            triggering options that might share data.
                                            4. **Restricting access**: In earlier versions of Windows 10, activating this mode not only hides the Defender client interface
                                            but also restricts users from accessing it [2]. If a user attempts to open the interface, they are met with a warning, indicating that
                                            access has been restricted by the system administrator [2].

                                            The script achieves this by making a specific change in the Windows Registry. Specifically, it adds a value named "UILockdown" in the
                                            `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\UX Configuration` registry path, setting its value to `1` [1].

                                            This script disables the "ExploitGuard MDM policy Refresh" scheduled task.

                                            The task is originally described in the Task Scheduler as: "Task for applying changes to the machine's Exploit Protection settings".

                                            Windows Defender Exploit Guard is a security feature in Windows, designed to prevent potential intrusions [1].
                                            It encompasses various components such as "Attack Surface Reduction (ASR)", "Network protection", "Controlled folder access", and "Exploit protection" [1].

                                            Specifically, the "ExploitGuard MDM policy Refresh" task is in charge of refreshing the Exploit Guard policy settings through Mobile Device Management (MDM) policies [2].
                                            MDM offers a method to remotely adjust the ExploitGuard settings on a device [2].

                                            Microsoft rolled out the Exploit Guard feature starting from Windows 10 version 1709 [3] [4].
                                            
                                            Notably, the National Security Agency (NSA) in the USA has recommended the use of this feature for enhanced security [3].

                                            This script disables the "Windows Defender Cache Maintenance" scheduled task.

                                            The task is scheduled to periodically maintain the cache used by Microsoft Defender Antivirus [1].
                                            It runs the command `C:\Program Files\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe -IdleTask -TaskName WdCacheMaintenance` [1].
                                            The `MpCmdRun.exe` is a command-line tool used to perform various Microsoft Defender Antivirus functions [2].

                                            Cache maintenance involves managing temporary files that Microsoft Defender is either scanning or has quarantined [3]
                                            Disabling this task prevents the system from automatically clearing the Defender cache [3].

                                            This is particularly useful if you want to ensure that files are not removed from quarantine or the cache without your explicit action.
                                            Disabling this task is reported to optimize system boot speed [4] but it could potentially lead to increased storage use by temporary files.

                                            Even though the service is related to Microsoft Defender [4], disabling it does not turn off Microsoft Defender Antivirus [1].
                                            By default, Windows manually starts this service [2], but it is observed to run automatically in Windows 10 and 11.

                                            The "Windows Security" interface relies on the "Windows Security Service" which further depends on the "Windows Security Center Service" (`wscsvc`) [1].

                docs: |-
                    Disabling automatic updates is often considered counterintuitive when it comes to securing your system. However, there are substantial arguments
                    to consider this option if you're privacy-centric:

                    1. **Patching and Pre-Approval**: Manual control over update deployment allows for pre-emptive approval of patches. This strategy is useful
                    in environments requiring the highest level of security. For instance, military agencies frequently employ air-gapped systems that mandate
                    careful review of each update to mitigate risks such as potential backdoors or data leaks. Similarly, financial institutions often
                    resort to staged rollouts of updates, subjecting them to an in-depth analysis of their implications on security and privacy before broad
                    implementation.

                    2. **Telemetry and Data Transmission**: Automatic updates often come embedded with telemetry data collection mechanisms. Disabling these
                    updates facilitates granular control over the data transmitted back to Microsoft servers. Thus, the decision to disable automatic updates
                    allows you to control the timing and nature of information relayed to these servers.

                    3. **Peer-to-Peer Data Exposure**: Windows employs a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) approach to facilitate update distribution, which can
                    reveal your IP address and some system details to peer systems [1].

                    4. **Configurational integrity**: Updates have the capacity to change pre-configured settings without explicit user consent. This could
                    result in unintended alteration of your privacy settings, leaving you exposed until you realize the change.

                    > **Caution**: While controlling updates enhances your privacy, it can leave your system vulnerable to unpatched exploits.
                    Ensure that you manually review and apply updates on a regular basis. You're essentially trading off some security for a heightened level of
                    privacy.

                        docs: |-
                            This script deactivates the Automatic Updates feature in Windows. By disabling Automatic Updates,
                            you gain control over when your system is updated, which may be preferable in specific
                            privacy-sensitive environments.

                            The script changes a specific setting in your computer's registry, with a key called `NoAutoUpdate`, which has
                            two possible states [1] [2]:

                            - `0`: Automatic Updates are enabled.
                            - `1`: Automatic Updates are disabled.

                            By default, Windows comes with Automatic Updates enabled, meaning the `NoAutoUpdate` is set to `0` [3].

                            Running this script will set `NoAutoUpdate` to `1`, turning off Automatic Updates [1] [2] [3].
                            In doing so, you prevent your computer from automatically receiving updates, which is a feature
                            that could be considered intrusive or unwanted in some privacy-conscious settings.

                            It configure your computer to not automatically download and install updates without your explicit permission.

                            This script changes how your Windows computer handles automatic updates by modifying the `AUOptions` registry key.
                            After running this script, your computer will notify you before downloading any updates [1] [2] [3].

                            In the default setup, your Windows system is configured to download and install updates automatically without notifying you [4].
                            This means that new updates could be installed on your system without your explicit approval.

                            By forcing Windows to notify you before downloading updates, this script hands back control over your system to you.
                            This feature enhances your privacy and minimizes risks because you get to manually review and approve each update before it's installed.

                            To explain the technical aspect, the `AUOptions` registry key is a setting stored under
                            `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU` in your computer's registry [1] [3].
                            A value of `2` for `AUOptions` means that you will be notified before any updates are downloaded and installed [1] [2].
                            On older versions of Windows, setting this key to `1` would prevent the system from even checking for updates [5].
                            However, starting from Windows 10, the key `1` has a different meaning [2][3].

                            Running this script doesn't disable updates; it just ensures that you are informed and have the final say on
                            whether to download them or not.

                            This script stops Windows from automatically installing updates every day. By doing so, you gain control over when update
                            happen on your computer [1] [2].

                            By default, Windows is set to automatically update every day [2]. Having control over the update timing allows you to review
                            what is being changed, thereby protecting your privacy and enhancing your system's security.

                            Technically, what the script does is remove a specific setting in the computer's system registry, the `ScheduledInstallDay` key
                            from `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU` [1] [2].

                            Disabling the scheduled install day ensures that updates won't be forcibly applied on a specific day of the week.

                            This script turns off the automatic installation of Windows updates that are set to occur at a specific time.
                            By doing this, you take back control over when your computer updates itself [1] [2] [3].
                            The default behavior is to install updates at 3 AM [3].

                            Windows updates can be important for system security, but automatic installation could occur at inconvenient times and may even
                            restart your computer without prior warning. This could interrupt your tasks and may send data about your system to external servers.
                            By disabling the automatic scheduled installation time, you can manually control when updates are installed [3], ensuring that you're
                            aware of any changes to your system.

                            The script works by removing a specific registry key called `ScheduledInstallTime` under
                            `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU` [2] [3]. This is the system setting that controls the scheduled update time.

                            The scripts in this category offer users the ability to control Windows services related to system updates.
                            These services manage how and when your system receives updates from Microsoft. By limiting or disabling these services,
                            users can decide when to update their system, reducing unexpected changes. Moreover, a system with fewer running
                            services uses fewer resources, which can improve overall performance.

                            Disabling these update services is also a privacy measure. Some updates can change privacy settings or add features that
                            collect user data. By controlling update services, users can review and approve any changes before they take effect.

                            > **Caution**: Disabling Windows update services may lead to missed critical security patches and feature updates.
                            > Consider the balance between maintaining privacy and ensuring system security and stability.

                                    By disabling this service, the automatic detection, download, and installation of updates for both Windows and other
                                    installed programs are halted [3] [4].

                                    Update can often come bundled with changes that could affect your privacy settings or introduce features that collect
                                    more of your data. Taking control of when and how updates are applied provides you with the opportunity to review any changes
                                    before they take effect.

                                    By default, the service is enabled and set to start up manually [5].

                                    If you disable this service, you won't be able to use the Windows Update feature for automatic updates [5]. Additionally,
                                    other software on your computer won't be able to access the functionalities provided by the Windows Update Agent,
                                    commonly known as WUA API [5].

                                    This script disables the `upfc.exe` process, preventing it from automatically re-enabling Windows updates [5].

                                    `upfc.exe` is found at `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\upfc.exe` [1] [2].
                                    This executable is identified by Microsoft as "Updateability From SCM" [1] [2].
                                    SCM refers to the "Service Control Manager (SCM)", a special system process also known as `services.exe` [3].
                                    `upfc.exe` is automatically launched by SCM during system startup [4].
                                    It is part of the Windows Update self-healing mechanism [1].

                                    It recovers Windows Update Medic Service (`WaaSMedicSvc`) once disabled [1] [5].
                                    `upfc.exe` operates early in the boot process and performs several functions [1]:

                                    1. It checks the details of the `WaaSMedicSvc` against a configuration file, ensuring the service's settings match those listed [1].
                                    2. If discrepancies are found, such as invalid registry settings, `upfc.exe` recreates the service according to the XML configuration file [1].

                                    However, `upfc.exe` also sends data about its operations to Microsoft [1] [5], including details about discrepancies found and any corrective
                                    actions taken [1] [5]. This data is part of the telemetry Microsoft collects [1], which raises privacy concerns.

                                    This script will skip some of its disabling logic on older Windows versions due to community reports of disabling this service causing
                                    BSOD (blue screen of death) [5] [6].

                                    > **Caution:** By disabling `upfc.exe`, this script enhances user privacy by stopping the automatic sending of operational data to Microsoft.
                                    > However, it's important to note that this might impact the integrity and security of the Windows Update process. Users should weigh the
                                    > privacy benefits against potential security risks before using this script.

                        docs: |-
                            This category includes scripts to disable scheduled tasks that are associated with the automatic functioning of the Windows Update service.
                            These tasks are responsible for various background update-related activities such as checking for updates, downloading, and installing them
                            in the background without user intervention.

                            Disabling these tasks grants users more control over when and how updates are applied. This approach is often preferred by those wishing to
                            manually manage updates or avoid unanticipated system modifications without consent, and it is considered a best practice in high-security
                            environments where precise control over updates is crucial. However, it's important to exercise caution with these changes. Disabling automatic
                            updates can lead to missed critical security patches and feature updates, potentially leaving the system vulnerable.

                            To view all the scheduled tasks related to Windows Update, you can use the following PowerShell command:

                            ```powershell

                                    rebooting after updates, and more.
                                    
                                    Disabling these tasks can help reduce unnecessary system activity and potentially enhance privacy by limiting background update operations.

                        docs: |-
                            This category includes scripts designed to extend the intervals between automatic updates.
                            These scripts provide users with greater control over the timing of system updates.
                            By adjusting the schedule of these updates, users can minimize interruptions and potential system instability associated with frequent updates.

                            > **Caution**: Postponing updates can delay critical security fixes and feature enhancements,
                            > increasing potential security risks for your computer.

                                    This script maximizes the pause duration for system updates via the settings interface.
                                    It postpones both feature and quality updates in Windows 10 and Windows 11.
                                    This is particularly useful for those preferring fewer interruptions from regular updates.

                                    By default, the following registry keys are absent in Windows 10 and Windows 11 and are added only when updates are
                                    paused through the user interface [1]:

                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UX\Settings!PauseFeatureUpdatesStartTime`
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UX\Settings!PauseFeatureUpdatesEndTime`
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UX\Settings!PauseQualityUpdatesStartTime`
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UX\Settings!PauseQualityUpdatesEndTime`
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UX\Settings!PauseUpdatesStartTime` (set only in Windows 11 22H2 and later)
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UX\Settings!PauseUpdatesExpiryTime`

                                    This method has been tested and verified on Windows 10 from version 22H2 and Windows 11 from version 22H3 onwards.
                                    To ensure functional integrity, all these keys must be added together.

                                    While beneficial for Windows Home users [1], note that Group Policy Object (GPO) settings might override these changes.

                                    These updates bring major changes to the operating system, affecting functionality and user privacy [1] [2].

                                    Key aspects of Windows feature updates include:

                                    - Protecting against behavioral issues [1].
                                    - Adding new features [1].

                                    ### Registry keys

                                    The script modifies various Group Policy (GPO), state, and Mobile Device Management (MDM) keys.

                                    Group Policy (GPO) keys:

                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate!PauseFeatureUpdatesStartTime`:
                                        Sets the start date for pausing feature updates [3].
                                        It is specified in a date format (yyyy-mm-dd, e.g., 2018-10-28) [4].
                                        This key supersedes the now-obsolete Windows 10 version 1607 key: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate!PauseFeatureUpdates` [5].
                                        By default, this registry key is missing since Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 22H3.
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate!PauseFeatureUpdatesPeriodInDays`:
                                        Specifies the pause duration for feature updates [6].
                                        The range is from 0 (default) to 365 days [6].
                                        By default, this registry key is missing since Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 22H3.
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate!DeferFeatureUpdates`:
                                        Enables pausing of feature updates and activates `PauseFeatureUpdatesPeriodInDays` [5].
                                        By default, this registry key is missing since Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 22H3, meaning that the feature updates are not paused [7].
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate!DeferFeatureUpdatesPeriodInDays`:
                                        Allows pausing of feature updates for a specified number of days [4] [5] [7].
                                        It ranges from 0 to 365 days [5] [7].
                                        This key supersedes the now-obsolete Windows 10 version 1511 key: `HKLM\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate!DeferUpgradePeriod` [4] [5].
                                        By default, this registry key is missing since Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 22H3.
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate!Pause`:
                                        Used for pausing updates in older Windows 10 versions [4].
                                        By default, this registry key is missing since Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 22H3.

                        docs: |-
                            This script disables marking file attachments by using their zone information.

                            The default behavior is for Windows to mark file attachments with their zone information [1].
                            The zone information of the origin describe whether the file was downloaded from internet,
                            intranet, local, or restricted zone [1].

                            It is used by Attachment Manager that is included in Windows to help protect the computer from
                            unsafe attachments that can be received with e-mail message or downloaded from Internet [2].
                            If the Attachment Manager identifies an attachment that might be unsafe, it prevents you from
                            opening the file, or it warns you before you open the file [2].

                            Preventing this information to be saved:
                            - Increases privacy by no longer leaking information of source.
                            - Decreases security by preventing Windows to determine risks and take risk-based actions [1].
                            By not preserving the zone information, Windows cannot make proper risk assessments [3].
                            Disabling it has **Significant** criticality as the configuration introduces additional attack
                            surface according to US government [4].

                            The Attachment Manager feature warns users when opening or executing files which are marked as
                            being from an untrusted source, unless/until the file's zone information has been removed via
                            the "Unblock" button on the file's properties or via a separate tool such as
                            [Microsoft Sysinternals Streams](https://web.archive.org/web/20240314125039/https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/streams) [4].

                            It is configured using `SaveZoneInformation` value in
                            `\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Attachments\` registry subkey [1] [2] [3] [4].

                            The value is this setting is confusing, according to Microsoft documentation
                            `1` turns it on [2] [3], `2` turns it off [2] [3]. However, according to STIG V-63841, `1` disables
                            saving zone information and `2` enables it [3]. According to my tests, the STIG interprets it right
                            and `1` disables this function off.

                            In clean Windows 10 and 11 installations, this key by default is missing for both `HKCU` and `HKLM`.

                            Prevents Windows from calling the registered antivirus programs when file attachments are opened [1] [2].

                            Windows registered antivirus programs for downloaded files from Internet or through e-mail attachments [1].
                            If multiple programs are registered, they will all be notified [1] [3].
                            This is disabled by default, so even if you do not configure run this script, Windows does not call the registered
                            antivirus programs when file attachments are opened [1].

                            If it is enabled, Windows blocks file from being opened when antivirus program fails [1]. It is the recommended setting
                            by Microsoft [1].

                            Preventing calling antivirus:
                            - Increases privacy by not sharing your file data proactively with installed antiviruses.
                            - Decreases by detecting and mitigating potential malicious software. Disabling it has **Moderate**
                            criticality as it is not an appropriate antivirus configuration according to US government [4].

                            An updated antivirus program must be installed for this policy setting to function properly [4].

                            It is configured using `ScanWithAntiVirus` value in
                            `\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Attachments\` registry subkey [1] [2] [3] [4].
                            `3` enables the scans [1] [2] [3], `1` disables it [1] [3], and `2` leaves it optional [1].

                            In clean Windows 10 and 11 installations, this key by default comes with `3` value in
                            `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Attachments\ScanWithAntiVirus`,
                            and key is missing for `HKCU`.

                name: Remove "Windows Security" app (`SecHealthUI`) (breaks Windows Security user interface)
                docs: |-
                    This script removes the "Windows Security" app [1], known as `SecHealthUI` [2] [3].
                    This app serves as the interface for Windows Security [2], helping users monitor and manage their computer's security [4].
                    It provides alerts and guidance on vulnerabilities through the Action Center [4].

                    However, uninstalling the "Windows Security" app has significant implications:

                    - It may increase vulnerability to threats by no longer alerting users about security issues or communicating updates through the Action Center [4].
                    - Disabling its interface can hinder the effective management of security settings, including tamper protection [5].

                    Despite these risks, removing the app can enhance privacy in several ways:

                    - **Less personal data collection**: Reduces the collection and display of personal and system data such as threats [6], limiting information used to analyze user behavior.
                    - **More control over security settings**: Encourages managing security settings programmatically, reducing accidental misconfigurations and unauthorized access.
                    - **Decreased notifications and alerts**: Reduces the number of notifications that may expose sensitive information.
                    - **User choice in security tools**: Offers freedom to choose alternative privacy-focused security measures.
                    - **Increased anonymity**: By uninstalling the app, users reduce the amount of data shared under the terms of
                      [Microsoft's privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20231006103250/https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement),
                      which allows Microsoft to collect and share data with external entities when the app is in use.

                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [7] [8].
                    The package is named `Microsoft.Windows.SecHealthUI` on Windows 10 and `Microsoft.SecHealthUI` on Windows 11 [1] [2].

                    It operates independently from individual Defender features [9] and is updated separately from the operating system [10].
                    Uninstalling it does not disable Microsoft Defender Antivirus or Firewall [11],
                    and Windows will continue sending security notifications unless disabled separately [12].

                    > **Caution**: Uninstalling "Windows Security" app can expose your system to threats and limit your ability to configure
                    > security settings. It should only be done with a full understanding of the consequences.

                    again, your computer can restore all the open programs and documents from your hard disk to its RAM [1].

                    If hibernation mode is enabled, sensitive data stored in RAM are be written to disk [2]. The memory can contain private data, passwords, keys and so
                    on. This could be accessed by malicious software or people with physical access to the computer. By disabling hibernation, this script reduces the risk
                    of such potential privacy breaches.

                    It configures hibernate by using `powercfg` command line tool [3].

                category: Remove Windows apps
                docs: |-
                    This category covers the uninstallation of Windows apps.

                    Windows apps were introduced with Windows 8 and are typically acquired and installed through the Store app [1].
                    Many of these apps come pre-installed on Windows by default [1].

                    Uninstalling unused or unwanted apps contributes to privacy by reducing potential data collection points and minimizing your digital footprint.

                    The applications are categorized as:

                    - **Installed**: Included with the OS installation [1] [2]. They are stored in the `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\{PackageFullName}` directory [1].
                    - **Provisioned**: Added when you log in with a new user account for the first time [1] [2] [3].
                    They are located in `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\{PackageFullName}` [1].
                    Following PowerShell command can be used to view all provisioned apps:
                    `Get-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online | Format-Table DisplayName, PackageName, PublisherId` [3].
                    - **System apps**: Integral components of Windows [1] [2].

                    This category does not target framework apps. Framework apps are packages that get installed automatically if another application requires them [2]. If there are
                    applications depending on these framework packages, you cannot delete the framework app individually [2]. However, if you remove those dependent applications, the
                    associated framework package will be deleted [4]. To list all framework apps, you can use the following command:
                    `Get-AppxPackage | Where-Object { $_.IsFramework -eq $true } | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name`.

                            This script unininstalls the "App Connector" Windows app.

                            The App Connector app accesses elements like your location, camera, contacts, and calendars [1] [2] [3].
                            This raises some concerns about user privacy [2].

                            In simpler terms, the App Connector acts as a bridge, facilitating communication
                            between Microsoft services and other apps over the Internet [2] [4] [5]. It's primarily aimed at developers, enabling them to connect with
                            Microsoft cloud services, such as Azure, or with other internet-based applications [4]. It's essentially a means to allow services to interact with tools
                            like Microsoft Power Automate, Microsoft Power Apps, and Azure Logic Apps [4]. Common services that can be connected using this include Salesforce,
                            Office 365, Twitter, Dropbox, and Google services [4].

                            To secure these connections, connectors typically use OAuth or usernames and passwords [5].

                            This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [6]. It was last seen on Windows 10 1511.

                            This category provides scripts for uninstalling pre-installed 3D modeling applications from Windows.

                            3D modeling applications allow users to create, visualize, and manipulate three-dimensional objects in a virtual space.
                            They are particularly useful for designers, artists, and professionals who need to create 3D designs for various purposes.

                            These apps, while useful for certain users, might not be required by everyone, thus providing the option to uninstall them.

                                recommend: standard # Deprecated application with known security vulnerabilities; removal does not impact essential system functionality
                                docs: |-
                                    This script uninstalls the "Print 3D" application.

                                    This app enhances 3D printing by supporting network printers, optimizing settings, and rendering objects realistically [1].

                                    However, this app poses certain risks.
                                    The application can access the Internet, home or work networksm and your 3D objects [1].
                                    It has known serious security vulnerabilities such as "Remote Code Execution Vulnerability" [2].
                                    These vulnerabilities allow attackers to remotely execute malicious code on your system.
                                    This app is no longer supported [3], and Microsoft does not plan to issue patches [2].

                                    Removing this app mitigates security risks, enhances privacy by reducing data exposure,
                                    and frees up system resources, potentially improving performance.

                                    Microsoft has deprecated the "Print 3D" app in favor of the "Microsoft 3D Builder" app [3].
                                    It is recommended to upgrade to this newer application for ongoing support and features.

                                    This script removes both the legacy `Windows.Print3D` and the current `Microsoft.Print3D` packages from your system.
                                    `Windows.Print3D` package name is changed to `Microsoft.Print3D` since Windows 1903 [4].

                                    This script uninstalls the "Microsoft 3D Builder" app.

                                    Microsoft 3D Builder offers tools for creating, viewing, and printing 3D objects [1].
                                    It supports editing various 3D file types with features like material rendering, texture layering, 
                                    and includes tools to prepare models for 3D printing [1].

                                    This app succeeded the older "Print 3D" app as the default 3D printing software starting with the Windows 10 version 19H1 [2].

                                    This application uses your webcam, microphone, and internet connection [1], posing privacy risks due to potential data exposure.
                                    Uninstalling this app reduces privacy risks, frees up system resources, and minimizes the attack surface, thereby enhancing security.

                            This category includes scripts to uninstall MSN (sometimes branded as "Bing" or just "Microsoft") applications from Windows.

                            MSN apps come bundled with Windows and provide users with information from various domains such as weather, sports, news,
                            and finance. While they offer easy access to curated content right from the desktop, not all users find them essential.

                            If users prefer other sources or tools for this information, they might wish to uninstall these default apps to declutter their system.

                            This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1] [2] [3].

                            "Get Help" is an application designed to assist users with Windows-related issues [4]. It offers solutions through
                            troubleshooters, instant answers, and Microsoft support articles. It connects users with Microsoft support agents
                            and the Microsoft community for personalized assistance [4].

                            Removing "Get Help" not only supports a minimalist system approach but also helps reduce potential data collection.
                            Typically, support tools like "Get Help" gather diagnostic data and user interactions, which are used to improve service and

                            However, removing "Get Help" disrupts some system support functionalities. For instance, the built-in internet
                            troubleshooting feature will cease to function [5]. Attempts to diagnose network problems from the system tray will result in
                            an error message, indicating the absence of an application to manage the troubleshooting process [5].

                            The script also affects system-generated URLs such as `ms-contact-support://oem/<Manufacturer>`, which direct to OEM-specific
                            support services [6]. Post-removal, users will need to identify alternative support options for system troubleshooting.

                            Extension apps are add-ons that enhance functionality related to media, images, and other software capabilities.

                            Many of these extensions come pre-installed on some Windows versions [1].
                            While they can be helpful, not everyone needs them.

                            Unused extensions can present security risks due to potential critical vulnerabilities [2] [3].
                            A critical vulnerability is a serious security risk that could allow attackers to gain full control of your system.
                            This risk is heightened because extensions usually have extensive access to the system.

                            By using these scripts, you can remove unnecessary extensions to improve your computer's security and lower the risk
                            of cyber attacks, a proactive measure for security and privacy.

                            > **Caution:** Uninstalling extensions could affect certain features, such as media playback or image processing.

                            This category focuses on scripts that help uninstall select Microsoft Office apps that may come pre-installed with Windows.

                            Microsoft Office suite is a popular productivity suite, providing tools for a wide range of tasks like document creation,
                            note-taking, and interactive presentation development. However, while many of these apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint are
                            commonly used, some other apps like My Office, OneNote, and Sway might not be essential for all users. Especially, if users have
                            other preferred tools or the web versions suit their needs better.

                            This category houses scripts dedicated to uninstalling specific applications related to the Microsoft Store.
                            As the digital storefront for Microsoft, the Microsoft Store is a hub for apps, games, movies, and other content.
                            While it provides a convenient method of obtaining software, some users might wish to uninstall or disable it for
                            reasons like performance optimization or data privacy concerns.

                            As always, when disabling or uninstalling core system apps, it is crucial to be informed of the potential repercussions
                            and act carefully.

                                    This script aims to uninstall the Microsoft Store app (also known as Store [1]).
                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1] [2] [3] [4].

                                    Microsoft has mentioned that it doesn't officially support the uninstallation of this app [4] [5]. Removing it might lead to unwanted
                                    effects [5].

                                    The Microsoft Store is subject to the data collection policies laid out in the Windows privacy statement [6]. It can collect diagnostic
                                    data about your device, its settings, and capabilities [7]. This data is sent to Microsoft and can include unique identifiers, potentially
                                    allowing Microsoft to recognize a user and their device [7]. Additionally, the data can offer insights into your device's settings,
                                    capabilities, health, visited websites, device activity (or usage), and, the memory state of your device [7]. Sometimes, this might
                                    inadvertently include parts of a file you are using [7].

                                    From a security perspective, the Microsoft Store increases potential risks, as it has known vulnerabilities [8].

                                    To address privacy and security concerns, it might be beneficial to disable the Microsoft Store and explore alternative methods for
                                    software package management. However, considering the official stance from Microsoft on uninstallation, it's important to understand that
                                    this action might affect some core functionalities of the operating system.

                                    This application provides TCUI functionality [1]. Title-callable UI (TCUI) is a feature that allows game code to invoke pre-defined

                                    Uninstalling this script can contribute to user privacy by removing unnecessary apps that may have predefined interfaces linked with
                                    Xbox Live, minimizing potential data interactions with the system.

                                    This app enables your PC games to connect to Xbox Live [1].
                                    Its removal can help prevent personal gaming data from being shared with Microsoft's servers.

                                    Running this script will impact:

                                    - Xbox sign-in for certain games, making it impossible to log in [2] [3] [4].
                                    - Log-in functionality for Xbox Game Pass, leading to errors and inability to access games [5] [6].
                                    - Log-in to the Xbox app itself [2] [4] [7] [8].

                                    Common errors caused by the absence of this app include:

                                    - "We tried to sign you in to your Microsoft Account, but something went wrong" [6].
                                    - "You are not signed in to Xbox Live" [6].
                                    - "We couldn't sign you in to Xbox Live. User Interaction is required for Authentication" [6].
                                    - "We can't sign you in right now. Try again later. (`0x406`)" [7] [8].

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [9] [10] [11] [12].

                                    This script uninstalls the "Xbox Speech To Text Overlay" app.

                                    The app offers a speech-to-text feature for certain Xbox games. Specifically, it turns spoken words during a party chat into text which then
                                    appears on the game screen [1]. This function is also termed as "game and chat transcription", and is compatible with games that support this feature [2].

                                    The removal of this app can help in reclaiming system resources and enhancing user privacy, as it would reduce the number of tools with potential voice
                                    data access. After uninstalling, the speech-to-text functionality in supported Xbox games may no longer be available.

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [3] [4] [5].

                            This category features scripts for managing Windows apps related to smartphones.
                            These scripts are for apps that connect smartphones to Windows, including dialer and other phone-related apps, even those that are outdated or replaced.
                            The scripts aim to let users control whether these apps stay or go, improving their control over personal settings.

                            These applications may pose privacy concerns due to their data sharing and synchronization capabilities.
                            Removing these apps improves privacy by stopping unwanted data sharing with Microsoft and reducing security risks.
                            This also improves system performance by reducing process count.

                            > **Caution:** Removal might affect smartphone integration features.
                            > Ensure you understand the implications and have alternative solutions if you rely on these features for your daily tasks.

                                    It provided setup instructions and syncing tips [1].
                                    The app enabled users to check their device's battery and storage status and transfer files [1].
                                    It supported Windows, Android, and iOS devices [1].

                                    This app has been absent in Windows versions since October 2018, replaced by the *Phone Link* app [3].
                                    Removing this app enhances privacy and system performance.

                                    > **Caution:** Removal may impact device synchronization on older Windows versions reliant on this app's unique features.

                                    This script removes the "Phone Link" app.
                                    Known technically as `Microsoft.YourPhone` [1] [2] [3],
                                    previously *Your Phone* [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] and *Your Phone Companion* [4].

                                    The app links your phone and Windows PC.
                                    It allows you to share and manage content and communications across devices [5] [7] [8].
                                    The app lets you text, make calls, use mobile apps, get notifications, and transfer files over Wi-Fi [5] [7] [8].

                                    Launched in October 2018 as *Your Phone* and *Your Phone Companion* [4],
                                    it was rebranded to *Microsoft Phone Link* in March 2022 [4] [9].
                                    Originally developed for Android [8], through collaboration between Microsoft and Samsung [8],
                                    it has extended support to iOS devices since April 26, 2023 [10].

                                    Privacy concerns arise from personal data handling, unencrypted data transfer, and potential misuse:

                                    - **No End-to-End Encryption:**
                                        It is not end-to-end encrypted, raising doubts about data privacy and security during transfers [11].
                                    - **Microsoft personal data collection:**
                                        Personal data, including text messages, clipboard contents, photos, and notifications, are collected by Microsoft [6].
                                        Microsoft confirms it stores and processes such data [6].
                                    - **Malicious Usage**:
                                        Misuse of the app, such as setting it up on a victim's phone to monitor communications without consent [12] [13], increases data leakage risks.
                                    - **Lack of Privacy Transparency:**
                                        The Microsoft Privacy Statement does not explicitly clarify that personal data is relayed through its servers, leading to possible
                                        misconceptions about data handling [6] [14].
                                        Microsoft's approach to privacy is criticized for lacking transparency [6] [11].
                                    - **Sensitive Information Exposure:**
                                        Data exposed to Microsoft, or can be received by an attacker can include sensitive information such as the content of private messages, security
                                        codes from authentication apps, caller identities, and more [6] [12].
                                        This can contain personal, financial, or security-related data [6] [12].
                                    - **Diagnostic Data Collection:**
                                        The app collects diagnostic data, including potentially sensitive information about app usage [6].
                                    - **Account Takeover:**
                                        The app could be used in account takeover attempts by intercepting multi-factor authentication notifications [12].
                                    - **Attack vector surface on Android:**
                                        Android devices face more potential attack vectors than iOS devices due to internet-based connectivity [12].

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [2] [3].

                                    This script removes the "Call" application, also known as the *Calling Shell App* [1].

                                    This app enables transferring and managing phone calls from a mobile to a Windows desktop, including playback
                                    through PC speakers [2].
                                    The main executable of this app is `CallingShellApp.exe`, which Microsoft describes as the
                                    "Calling App to host call progress on shell" [3].

                                    The script is safe to use if you don't need your PC to handle phone calls [3].
                                    Removing this app does not affect the core functionalities of Windows.

                            This category includes scripts for uninstalling default system apps in Windows.

                            System apps are pre-installed [1] [2] applications located in the `C:\Windows*` directory [1] [2].
                            These apps are typically found on `C:\Windows\SystemApps\{PackageFamilyName}` or `C:\Windows\{ShortAppName}` folders.

                            To view all system apps:

                            1. Open a PowerShell command prompt.
                            2. Execute the following command: `Get-AppxPackage -PackageTypeFilter Main | ? { $_.SignatureKind -eq "System" } | Sort Name | Format-Table Name, PublisherId, InstallLocation`

                            They are integral components of the Windows operating system [1].
                            However, by removing unnecessary system apps, users can enhance their privacy by reducing potential data
                            collection points and streamlining their system.

                                    This script uninstalls the "Microsoft AAD Broker Plugin" app. This app is also referred to as the "Work or school account" or "Broker plug-in" [1].
                                    The primary purpose of this app is to offer login functionality for what used to be Azure Active Directory and is now called Microsoft Entra ID [2].

                                    Users should be aware of the following side-effects before uninstalling:

                                    - For certain Windows versions, uninstalling this app disrupts the keyboard selection in the taskbar [3]. Clicking on the taskbar
                                    language selection icon will not show the selection dialog [3].
                                    - The Night Light feature, which adjusts the colors on your screen to reduce eye strain during the evening and night, will stop
                                    functioning after uninstalling [4]. You can read more about the Night Light feature
                                    [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20231003182409/https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/set-your-display-for-night-time-in-windows-18fe903a-e0a1-8326-4c68-fd23d7aaf136).
                                    - The authentication process for Office apps is affected, preventing users from signing in [5].

                                    Removing this app enhances user privacy by reducing potential data collection by the app. Yet, it's important to weigh
                                    the privacy benefits against the loss of the above functionalities.

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1] [6] [7].

                                    This category includes scripts to remove Microsoft Edge Legacy. Microsoft introduced the Legacy version based on the EdgeHTML
                                    engine [1] in 2015 [2]. However, as of March 9, 2021, they stopped supporting this version, implying it no longer gets
                                    security updates or patches [1] [2]. Keeping unsupported software on your system can pose security vulnerabilities.

                                    Initially, this version was the default browser on Windows 10 PCs [1]. Due to its tight integration with Windows, a simple uninstall
                                    might not eliminate all related files.

                                    One privacy concern with Microsoft Edge Legacy is how it handles your browsing history. When used, the browser integrates your browsing
                                    history into your device's activity log that is sent to Microsoft [3]. But, even if disabled, the data remains on your device [3].
                                    This local storage of data can be analyzed for your behavior, potentially compromising your privacy.

                                    By utilizing this script, you ensure a comprehensive removal of the browser and its related components, thus enhancing your system's
                                    privacy and security.

                                            risk. Furthermore, using this version means your browsing data gets integrated into your device's activity history [5]. Microsoft can
                                            access this data [5] and it remains stored locally, leaving traces of your behavior [5].

                                            Removing this software not only minimizes potential security threats but also improves your privacy by preventing data accumulation.

                                        name: Remove Edge (legacy) file and URL associations
                                        recommend: strict

                                            This script unlinks file and URL associations from the legacy Microsoft Edge, ensuring that it is not mistakenly recognized as
                                            the default browser on your system.

                                            When you remove Microsoft Edge and don't disconnect its associations as the default browser, certain Windows functionalities may
                                            malfunction, as reported by users [1]. The standard uninstallation method for Microsoft Edge does not unlink these associations,
                                            leading to possible issues.

                                            For newer versions of Windows (specifically, Windows 10 21H2 and Windows 11 21H2 and beyond), the Chromium-based Edge is associated
                                            with majority of default options (with ProgIDs `MSEdgePDF` and `MSEdgeHTM` [2]), however there are still associations for legacy Edge.

                                            The legacy Microsoft Edge is associated with several ProgIDs, such as `AppX4hxtad77fbk3jkkeerkrm0ze94wjf3s9` and `AppXd4nrz8ff68srnhf9t5a8sbjyar1cr723`,
                                            all prefixed with `AppX` [3].

                                            To check the specific file and URL associations handled by Edge, you can look under the following registry keys, although not
                                            all these keys are registered by the operating system:

                                            - `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModel\Repository\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_{Version}\MicrosoftEdge\Capabilities\URLAssociations`
                                            - `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModel\Repository\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_{Version}\MicrosoftEdge\Capabilities\FileAssociations`

                                            Within these keys:

                                            - URL associations include `http`, `https`, `microsoft-edge`, and others.
                                            - File associations include `.htm`, `.html`, `.pdf`, and `.svg`.

                                            By running this script, you help in enhancing your system's privacy and ensuring that no unintended associations remain that could potentially cause
                                            vulnerabilities or other issues.

                                    This script uninstall the Microsoft Cloud Experience Host service.
                                    This service is required for connecting to corporate domains or Microsoft cloud-based services.
                                    It is also referred to as the "Microsoft account" app [1].
                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1] [2] [3].

                                    The Microsoft Cloud Experience Host has several functionalities:

                                    - It is responsible for connecting Microsoft accounts [4] [5].
                                    - It enables corporate login. Cloud Experience Host application comes into action during the joining process of workplace environments or Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) [6]. It renders the experience when collecting company-provided credentials [6]. After enrolling your device with your workplace environment or Azure AD, your organization can manage your PC and collect specific data about you, including your location [6]. The organization may add or remove apps, modify settings, disable certain features, prevent account removal, or even reset your PC [6].
                                    - It manages PIN, Biometric, and Device authentication [7]. This is needed for Windows Hello, which supports authentication through a device, biometric data, or a PIN code [7]. This functionality also assists in joining a machine to Azure AD or an on-premises AD domain [7].
                                    - Lastly, it aids in Out-of-box experience (OOBE) troubleshooting [8]. The OOBE comprises a series of screens such as the license agreement, internet connection, and login [9]. The service helps detect errors occurring during the OOBE flow [8].

                                    While the service does offer these essential functionalities, it also introduces notable privacy considerations.

                                    However, if one decides to uninstall it, they will encounter the following challenges:

                                    - The ability to sign in to Windows using a Microsoft account will be hampered, affecting cloud-based sign-in [10] [11].
                                    - The password and PIN sign-in options located in "Settings > Sign-in Options" will be inaccessible [12].

                                    This script uninstalls the "Content Delivery Manager" app.

                                    This app provides Windows Spotlight functionality [1], which automatically sets random wallpapers on the lock screen in Windows [2] [3].

                                    The main purpose of this app is to update the Windows experience [1].

                                    To achieve this, the app collects data about interactions with the Windows Spotlight content, such as which content is viewed,
                                    clicked on, or given feedback [1]. It records the content's ID, user actions, and other associated attributes [1]. Additionally, the app
                                    aggregates data about the state of content offers on a device, including the health of user accounts, the health status of the content
                                    delivery, and more specific metrics [1]. The app also keeps track of where the content is displayed, like on the LockScreen or Start menu,
                                    and when [1] [3]. This detailed tracking ensures that Windows stays up-to-date [1]. However, for users who prioritize privacy, understanding
                                    the data this app collects can be vital.

                                    The app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [4] [5].

                                    This script removes two specific apps from Windows:

                                    - `Microsoft.Windows.Cortana`: Commonly known as Cortana [1] [2] [3]. This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1] [2] [3].
                                    - `Microsoft.Windows.Search`: Introduced in Windows 10 2004, this app took over the role of `Microsoft.Windows.Cortana` to provide search functionality [4].
                                    The executable for this app is `SearchApp.exe`, located at `C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.Search_cw5n1h2txyewy\SearchApp.exe` [5] [6].
                                    This app powers the Windows search bar [5]. Some community reports have indicated that this app may collect data to display advertisements [7] [8].

                                    Removing these apps contributes to user privacy by eliminating potential data collection points. However, please note that running this script will disfunction
                                    the built-in Windows search functionality. Weigh the trade-off between improved privacy and the loss of search functionality before proceeding.

                                    When run, the app scans your computer's hardware to determine its compatibility with the Hololens [1]. It assesses which components meet or exceed the required
                                    specifications, which might offer a subpar experience, and which fail to meet the necessary standards [1]. The app accesses hardware data to ensure that
                                    the users have a system capable of supporting the Hololens [1].

                                    This app is pre-installed in specific Windows versions [2].

                                            users during their initial setup of a Windows device [1]. When setting up, users encounter the "Let's connect you to a network" screen, which lists available
                                            Wi-Fi and Cellular network options [1]. Devices with LTE capabilities and an active SIM card will automatically connect to the Cellular network, but if a Wi-Fi
                                            network is accessible, it will be preferred [1]. To ensure users don't consume excessive data during setup, Windows limits the download to essential updates
                                            when on metered networks [1].

                                            After establishing a network connection, the device starts downloading necessary driver and Windows Zero-Day Patch (ZDP) updates, which are necessary for device
                                            performance and security [1]. Users cannot opt-out of these updates [1]. If a newer Windows version is available and the device qualifies, users will get an option
                                            to download this update at the OOBE's conclusion [1].

                                            The primary process for this app is `OOBENetworkConnectionFlow.exe` [2].

                                            This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [3] [4].

                                    This script uninstalls the parental control app for Microsoft Family Safety.

                                    A **parental control** app helps parents regulate the content their children access online, including how long they spend on devices [1].
                                    It provides features such as content filtering, screen time limit enforcement, activity monitoring, contact blocking, and activity reports [1] [2].

                                    **Family Safety**, a specific parental control tool from Microsoft, lets parents monitor and control their children's online activities [3].
                                    It offers the ability to filter unsuitable web content and gives parents insight into the search terms their children use on search engines [3].
                                    One notable function is the "safe search" feature that communicates with search engines to ensure adult material is excluded from search results [3].

                                    However, using Family Safety means Microsoft collects personal details such as names, email addresses, birth dates, and other diagnostic data [4].
                                    There's a privacy concern, especially regarding minors, because the tool actively logs the search terms children enter into search engines [3].
                                    While "safe search" promotes user safety, it communicates settings to various search engine platforms, potentially sharing user preferences and
                                    identifiable information with these third parties [3]. It's also worth noting that certain browsers, like Firefox, require extra measures to
                                    ensure secure connections [3]. Without these measures, there's a risk of user data interception or manipulation.

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [5] [6].

                                    This app is also known as "People Hub" [1] [2] or "Windows My People" [3] [4].
                                    It allows users to pin contacts to the Windows task bar [3].
                                    Additionally, users can drag and drop documents, photos, or videos onto a contact to share them [3].

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1] [2].

                                    Its main operational file is `PeopleExperienceHost.exe`, which can typically be located at
                                    `C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.PeopleExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\PeopleExperienceHost.exe` [4]. This process is commonly as "Windows My People" [4].

                                    By uninstalling pre-installed apps like "My People", users can reclaim system resources and potentially enhance privacy by reducing the
                                    number of apps that could access and share their data.

                                    This script removes the Second Tile Experience app from your computer. The Second Tile Experience helps in providing a feature in Windows that lets users create quick access shortcuts,
                                    called secondary tiles, to specific content from an app on their Start menu [1]. For example, it might be a shortcut to the weather of a city or a favorite news article. Secondary
                                    tiles act as direct entry points to parts of an app, like displaying real-time updates or leading to a particular feature [1]. While these tiles share some similarities with primary tiles
                                    in terms of showing detailed content and notifications, they differ in a few ways. First, secondary tiles are created based on the user's choice, and they get a prompt from the system asking
                                    for confirmation before pinning [1]. Second, these tiles can be deleted at any time, and this doesn't affect the main app [1].

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [2].

                                    From a privacy perspective, it's worth noting that individual secondary tiles might track user behaviors or preferences, which could be a concern for some users.

                                    This script uninstalls the "Take a Test" application, also known as "secure assessment browser" [1] [2] [3]. It is a feature in Windows primarily used for online testing
                                    in schools [4]. The purpose of this app is to create a secure environment where students can't access external computer or internet resources while taking a test [4].
                                    It restricts specific activities, like printing, taking screenshots, or opening other apps [4]. The software offers two usage modes: a basic secure mode and a more
                                    stringent "kiosk mode" for vital assessments [4].

                                    Educators and administrators have the flexibility to set various rules using this application [5]. For example, they can determine if the test allows screen monitoring,
                                    if students can get keyboard text suggestions, or if a specific test should auto-launch when the app is started [5]. They can also control printing permissions and determine
                                    which user accounts are permitted to take the test [5].

                                    The app collects data such as the username of the person taking the test and information about the particular tests being taken [5].

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1] [2]. Its technical implementation can be found under the name `SecureAssessmentBrowser.exe` at
                                    `C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.SecureAssessmentBrowser_cw5n1h2txyewy\SecureAssessmentBrowser.exe`[3].

                                    Introduced in Windows 1511 (Windows 10 Fall Update) [1], this app allows users to share feedback with
                                    Microsoft, primarily aimed at Windows Insider users [1].
                                    
                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [2].

                                    Removing this app contributes to privacy by eliminating a channel through which user feedback and usage
                                    data might be sent to Microsoft. It's particularly useful for users who prefer to minimize data sharing
                                    with external parties.

                                    This app acts as an intermediary tool that games can use to bring up common UI elements on the Xbox platform [1].
                                    These displays, consistent with the RS5 Gamebar style, offer functionalities such as profile viewing, game invite sending, people selection,

                                    This category includes scripts that remove applications providing printing-related user interfaces.
                                    These interfaces manage printing tasks from the desktop environment.
                                    Both system and third-party applications use these interfaces.

                                    Removing these apps benefits users who do not use physical printing or prefer alternative methods.
                                    This can streamline system operations and enhance security by reducing the attack surface.
                                    Additionally, removing these apps enhances your data privacy by preventing unauthorized printing of sensitive documents.

                                    However, removing these essential printing interfaces can disrupt normal printing functions for dependent applications.
                                    Users should assess whether these apps are essential to their workflow before removal.
                                    Do not run these scripts if you rely on the operating system's printing functionality.

                                            This script removes the "Print Queue" app [1] [2] [3],
                                            also known as the *Print Queue Action Center* [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].

                                            This app replaces the older print queue dialog with a modern user interface (UI) [3] [5].
                                            It enables users to view and manage their print jobs, including pausing and resuming them [1] [2].

                                            The app first appeared in an early version of Windows 11 (build 22567.1) [5].
                                            It became fully functional in later updates (starting with build 22572.1) [3].
                                            The Windows 11 22H2 update includes it for general users [6].

                                            To determine if this app is essential for your workflow, launch it from the terminal using the following
                                            command to explore its features before deciding on its removal [1] [2]:

                                            ```

                                            This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [4] [2] [5] [3] [6].

                                            Uninstalling this app can improve system performance by reducing background processes.

                                            This script removes the "Print UI" system application.
                                            This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1] [2].

                                            First introduced in early development builds of Windows 10 [3] [4] [5], the "Print UI" app
                                            is crucial for the native printing experience in Windows. When users click the Print button in
                                            apps such as Photos or early versions of Edge browser (before Chromium), this UI is displayed [6] [7].
                                            Since the release of Windows 11 22H2, Microsoft has replaced the legacy print dialog for all
                                            classic apps (like Notepad and WordPad) with this newer interface [8].

                                            To determine if this app is essential for your workflow, launch it from the terminal using the following
                                            command to explore its features before deciding on its removal [3] [4] [5]:

                                            ```
                                            explorer.exe shell:AppsFolder\Windows.PrintDialog_cw5n1h2txyewy!Microsoft.Windows.PrintDialog
                                            ```

                                            The app is located at `C:\Windows\PrintDialog` [6] [7].

                                            Removing it may enhance system performance and security by reducing unnecessary components and the attack surface.
                                            It's safe to remove if you use applications that have their own printing dialogs or that directly request a
                                            different user interface from the operating system.

                                            However, applications like the Photos app, which depend on hard-coded calls to this UI, may lose printing
                                            functionality if the app is removed [6] [7].
                                            Therefore, it is advisable not to remove this app if you rely on such applications for printing.

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > This may significantly impair your ability to print.
                                            > Removing this application may disrupt the ability of other apps to initiate printing tasks.

                            This script will call official Microsoft uninstaller that will uninstall the application but residual files will be left.
                            You won't lose data by uninstalling OneDrive from computer because they will be stored in cloud [1].

                            Running OneDrive client setup package (`OneDriveSetup.exe`) with the `/uninstall` command line switch uninstalls OneDrive [2] [3].
                            On Windows 10, the setup package is found on different folders (`System32` or `SysWOW64`) based on the CPU architecture [4].
                            On Windows 11, the setup package is always inside `System32` regarding of the CPU architecture.

                            Uninstalling OneDrive is recommended by Microsoft to optimize Windows VDIs [5].

                        docs: |-
                            This script deletes the OneDrive directory and all stored data from your profile.

                            OneDrive usually saves your data in the `%USERPROFILE%\OneDrive` directory [1] [2], also known as the *OneDrive folder*
                            or *OneDrive root directory* [2].
                            By default, OneDrive stores user data in folder called *OneDrive* [1].
                            For multiple accounts, files may be in *OneDrive - Personal* or *OneDrive - CompanyName* folders [1] [3].

                            OneDrive can synchronize default Windows folders like *Documents*, *Pictures*, *Music*, and *Desktop* [4] [5] [6] [7].
                            These folders are known as *user shell folders* [6] or *Windows system folders* [7].
                            Upon synchronization, these folders are moved within the OneDrive user data directory [5] [8].

                            Users may enable this synchronization unknowingly during Windows setup by choosing *Save files to OneDrive* option [9] [10].
                            Alternatively, synchronization can be enabled later through OneDrive settings [4]. OneDrive
                            may also prompt users to *set up protection of important folders* [11], a feature also referred to as *protect your folders* or *Known
                            Folder Move (KFM)* [11]. Additionally, an organization may move files of their managed computers to OneDrive using methods such as the
                            *Windows Folder Redirection Group Policy* [8].

                            This script contains safeguards to protect against unintended consequences:

                            1. **System Integrity Protection**:

                               The script verifies if any user shell folders are linked to the OneDrive directory.
                               This is crucial as redirecting these folders to OneDrive can cause system integrity issues.
                               For instance, if the *Desktop* folder is redirected to OneDrive, deleting the OneDrive folder could make the *Desktop* inaccessible.
                               The script stops and warns if any user shell folders are found within OneDrive.

                               > 💡 Move these folders back to their original locations using the
                               > `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders` registry key [6] before proceeding.

                            2. **Data Loss Prevention**:

                               The script avoids deleting files or non-empty directories to prevent accidental data loss.

                               > 💡 Manually empty these directories before running the script or opt to delete them afterward if needed.

                            The OneDrive folder has been confirmed to exist in modern versions of Windows, tested since Windows 11 (since 22H2)
                            and Windows 10 (since 22H2).

                            This script ensures the removal of all OneDrive shortcuts from your system, even after uninstallation or cleanup.

                            Erasing these shortcuts improves the security and privacy of your computer system, lessening the potential access points for
                            unwanted entities.

                            Moreover, the removal of unused shortcuts results in a more organized and efficient system, enhancing your user experience by
                            preventing any confusion from dead shortcuts.

                            Shortcuts that link to OneDrive are stored in various locations, such as:

                            - `Start Menu\Programs\Microsoft OneDrive.lnk`, `Start Menu\Programs\OneDrive.lnk`, `Links\OneDrive.lnk` [1],
                            - `ServiceProfiles\LocalService` and `ServiceProfiles\NetworkService` [1]

                            Below are the tested shortcut file locations on default installation (since Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 22H2):

                            | Path | Windows 11 | Windows 10 |
                            | ---- |:----------:|:----------:|
                            | `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\OneDrive.lnk` | ✅ Exists | ✅ Exists |
                            | `%USERPROFILE%\Links\OneDrive.lnk` | ❌ Missing | ❌ Missing |
                            | `%WINDIR%\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\OneDrive.lnk` | ❌ Missing | ✅ Exists |
                            | `%WINDIR%\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\OneDrive.lnk` | ❌ Missing | ✅ Exists |

                            In Windows 10 and higher, additional steps are necessary to delete the OneDrive icon from the navigation pane in Windows
                            Explorer [2], which is executed by this script.

                            These policies do not exist by default in clean installations.

                        name: Disable OneDrive scheduled tasks
                        recommend: strict
                        docs: |-
                            This script disables the scheduled tasks associated with Microsoft OneDrive that typically
                            run maintenance activities such as auto-updates [1] [2] [3] and data collection [2].
                            Disabling these tasks impacts OneDrive's automatic background update process [1] [2] [3].

                            By default, Windows 10 (since 22H2) and Windows 11 (since 22H2) include the following tasks:
                            - `OneDrive Standalone Update Task` [1] [2] [3]
                            - `OneDrive Reporting Task` [1]

                            These tasks are enabled by default and lack official documentation from Microsoft. They can be identified
                            by executing `Get-ScheduledTask 'OneDrive *' | Select -ExpandProperty TaskName` in PowerShell.
                            These tasks are observed to persist even after OneDrive is uninstalled.

                            The tasks appear with a Security Identifier (SID) unique to each installation [1], following this pattern:
                            - `OneDrive Reporting Task-S-1-5-21-xxxxxx`
                            - `OneDrive Standalone Update Task-S-1-5-21-xxxxxx`

                            The SID, denoted by 'xxxxxx', varies per installation and represents the user account associated with the task.
                            SID of user accounts always start with `S-1-5-21` [4], the rest of the number chages per user.
                            To see all user SIDs, you can run `wmic useraccount get Name,sid`.
                            The SID for your account can be confirmed using `whoami /user`.
                            A SID which doesn't correspond to any user account may appear.
                            This is be due to system preparation processes (`sysprep`) that use different SIDs for tasks to prevent duplication [5].

                            Disabling tasks with standard user SIDs is straightforward, but attempting to disable tasks with unpredictable SIDs can
                            result in an error message: `Catastrophic failure (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80000FFF (E_UNEXPECTED))`.

                            Nonetheless, disabling tasks with the correct SID is achievable using the provided script, which locates the full task names
                            including the SIDs.

                            If OneDrive is installed for all users on a machine (which is not the default behavior [6]), an additional task is present:
                            - `OneDrive Per-Machine Standalone Update` [1] [7].

                            Disabling the `OneDrive Standalone Update Task` is recommended by Microsoft to improve system performance and reduce
                            unnecessary data collection [2].

                    This category automates the uninstallation of Microsoft Edge (also known as "Chromium Edge" or "New Edge" [1]), the web browser that comes
                    pre-installed with many versions of Windows.

                    Microsoft Edge collects various types of data, some of which pertain to your browsing habits, such as the websites you visit, your search
                    queries, and the data you enter into forms [2]. Additionally, it tracks usage metrics and diagnostic data about your device data and
                    how the browser is functioning [2]. These pieces of information could be used for targeted advertising or profiling. Removing Microsoft
                    Edge ensures that it is not silently accumulating this data in the background, thereby improving your overall privacy.

                    By default, Microsoft Edge doesn't allow uninstallation and has officially declared Microsoft Edge as uninstallable on Windows [3].

                            This script uninstalls the Microsoft Edge using the official installer.

                            1. **Enable Uninstallation**: The script modifies a specific registry key to allow the uninstallation of Microsoft Edge. This step is crucial
                            because, starting from version 116 of Edge, you cannot uninstall it unless this registry key is set.
                            2. **Run Uninstaller**: The script then finds the Microsoft Edge installer (`setup.exe`) for every Microsoft Edge installation (it is possible
                            to have multiple versions) and executes it to perform a system-level uninstall.

                            There's no official documentation for the Edge installer or registry keys codes, which this script relies on. However, these have been verified
                            through testing and community support to work as expected.

                        docs: |-
                            This script disconnects file and URL associations related to the Microsoft Edge browser on your computer. When you uninstall Edge, these
                            associations remain intact, leading to potential unexpected behaviors [1] and vulnerabilities when opening specific file types or URLs.

                            The script is recommended for enhancing the stability and privacy of your system by avoiding unintentional interactions with these leftover
                            settings. It particularly addresses associations found under specific registry keys:

                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Clients\StartMenuInternet\Microsoft Edge\Capabilities\FileAssociations`
                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Clients\StartMenuInternet\Microsoft Edge\Capabilities\URLAssociations`

                            Note that not all these associations are registered for Edge by the OS by default. Specifically, the removed associations have an `MSEdge` prefix,
                            covering program IDs such as `MSEdgePDF` and `MSEdgeHTM` [2].

                            Clearing these associations, which are not removed by the official Edge uninstaller, mitigates the risk of exposure to system vulnerabilities due to
                            these lingering settings. Your system remains cleaner, more stable, and more private, ensuring a more secure user experience.

                            This script removes Microsoft Edge shortcuts from specific locations on your computer, enhancing the privacy and
                            integrity of your system.

                            When installed, Microsoft Edge, places shortcuts in various locations on your computer. Even after uninstalling the
                            Edge browser, some of these shortcuts may not be removed (tested since ≥ Edge v117). This script ensures the
                            removal of these residual shortcuts.

                            These shortcuts can serve as access points for malicious entities, potentially compromising your computer's security
                            and privacy. By deleting these shortcuts, the script helps in reducing these vulnerabilities, thus contributing to
                            a more secure and private computing environment.

                            Besides contributing to privacy and security, removing these unused shortcuts also contributes to a cleaner and more
                            organized computer system, providing an enhanced user experience.

                            The script specifically targets and removes shortcuts from the following paths, which have been tested and verified to
                            exist on default installations of Windows since Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 22H2:

                    Windows 11 adds a new taskbar flyout named "Widgets", which displays a panel with Microsoft Start, a news aggregator
                    with personalized stories and content (expanding upon the "news and interests" panel introduced in later builds of Windows 10) [1].
                    It's rebranding/future version of older "Windows 10 News and Interests" feature [2].
                    The user can customize the panel by adding or removing widgets, rearranging, resizing, and personalizing the content [1].

                    It has privacy implications as it collects data about your usage of the computer such as diagnostics data [3].

                            To control whether the Widgets button is visible on the taskbar, Microsoft introduced `TaskbarDa` registry value [1].
                            Possible `DWORD` 32-bit settings for the `TaskbarDa` value are [1] [2]:

                            1. 0 = Hidden
                            2. 1 = Visible

                            This registry key does not exist in Windows 11 installations by default.

                    It integrates with Bing Chat to deliver web results [1], and supports generating creative content, like images [1] [2],
                    and providing personalized suggestions based on user data analysis [2].

                    While these features enhance user experience, they raise privacy concerns due to the extensive personal
                    data access and processing involved, including user files [4], keyboard and voice inputs [3], and browser
                    history [3].
                    Such data is transmitted to Microsoft's servers [3].
                    Transmitting this data to Microsoft poses potential privacy and security risks.

                    Moreover, Copilot's susceptibility to attacks like prompt engineering underlines its security risks [5].

                    Removing Windows Copilot reduces privacy and security risks, improves system performance, and simplifies
                    the user interface.

                            This script deactivates the Windows Copilot feature, enhancing user privacy and potentially improving system performance.
                            By default, Copilot is enabled and appears on the taskbar when available [1] [2].

                            Disabling Windows Copilot prevents it from appearing on the taskbar and stops it from functioning [1] [2].
                            This action is useful for users who prioritize privacy and system performance, as it eliminates a potential
                            channel for data sharing with Microsoft servers and reduces the attacks on language models [3]. 
                            Read more: [Attacks on language models](https://erkinekici.com/articles/attacks-on-language-models/).

                            The script operates by modifying two registry keys:

                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsCopilot!TurnOffWindowsCopilot`:
                              This key disables Copilot for all users on the device [2] [4].
                            - `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsCopilot!TurnOffWindowsCopilot`:
                              This key disables Copilot for the current user [1] [4].

                            To fully disable Copilot, both machine-level (`HKLM`) and user-level (`HKCU`) settings might need
                            adjustment, given reports that `HKLM` alone is inadequate [4].

                            This script turns off Copilot, enhancing privacy by preventing data collection and transmission,
                            and improving security by reducing the risk of language model attacks [3].

                            This script disables Copilot access on your computer, enhancing your privacy.

                            It prevents the Copilot feature from activating or being suggested for use locally [1] [2].

                            When activated, Copilot can access and process a vast array of personal data, potentially leading to privacy concerns.
                            By setting your local user's eligibility status to "ineligible" this script effectively removes the possibility of Copilot
                            being automatically offered or activated on your system.

                            It works by adjusting the `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\Copilot\BingChat!IsUserEligible` registry key [1] [2] [3].
                            Typically, this key may be modified by Microsoft based on your account activity [3].
                            However, running this script will override such adjustments, maintaining your privacy preference and potentially
                            enhancing system performance by disabling background services.

                            Please restart your computer after applying this script to activate changes [2] [3].
                            If reverting, relog into your Microsoft account to reset settings [3].

                            This script stops the Copilot feature from automatically starting up with Windows,
                            providing a more controlled and resource-efficient computing experience.

                            With the release of Windows 11 builds 25992 (Canary) and 23615 (Dev), users encountered a new functionality
                            that would auto-launch Copilot on wider screens [1] [2] [3].

                            This script modifies the `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Notifications\Settings!AutoOpenCopilotLargeScreens`
                            registry key to configure this setting [1] [2].

                            This script ensures Copilot stays inactive at startup, activating only when the user initiates it manually.
                            This change not only respects user preference but also frees up system resources that would otherwise be consumed by this feature,
                            potentially leading to faster startup times and better overall performance.

                            Windows added a taskbar button enabled by default to launch Windows Copilot [1].
                            This feature was introduced with the Windows 11 22H2 Moments 4 update [2] [3].

                            The script configures the `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced!ShowCopilotButton`
                            registry key [3] [4].

                            This script will turn off the Copilot button in the Settings app of Windows 11, which will hide or remove
                            the Copilot icon from the taskbar [4].

                            Disabling the Copilot button won't uninstall the feature but will hide the icon from the taskbar, simplifying
                            the user interface and reducing distractions.

                            This action also reduces the visibility of a feature with privacy implications from data collection and processing.

                    This category contains scripts designed to enhance privacy by disabling system services that are not essential for your
                    operating system's core functions.

                    A Windows service is a program that runs in the background, automatically starting and operating without direct user
                    interaction, even when no user is logged in [1].

                    Disabling these services, especially those transmitting data to external parties or running unseen, significantly
                    reduces the risk of unwanted data exposure.

                    Taking these proactive steps is crucial for minimizing privacy risks and improving your system's security.

                            This script disables the **Windows Push Notification Service (WNS)** (`WpnService` and `WpnUserService`).
                            
                            WNS allows third-party developers to send a range of notifications, such as toast, tile, badge, and raw updates,
                            from their cloud services [1].

                            However, there are privacy concerns with this service:

                            - It relies on connections to Microsoft cloud servers [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] to deliver both local and push
                              notifications to your device [1].
                            - It can bypass VPN protections, exposing the device's real IP address, as noted in Wikipedia (uncited) [2].

                            This script disables `WpnService` (Windows Push Notifications System Service) [3] and
                            `WpnUserService` (Windows Push Notifications User Service) [4].
                            
                            > **Caution**: Disabling the `WpnUserService` system-wide impacts access to network settings on Windows 10,
                            > possibly causing issues with managing network connections [5] [6]. This issue does not occur on Windows 11 [5].

                            This script disables the **Shadow Copy** service, known also as the
                            *Volume Shadow Copy Service* (VSS) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] or *Volume Snapshot Service* [4] [6].
                            This service is integral for system backups [1] [2] [3] [5] and data snapshots [1] [5] [7].
                            It allows for data recovery [1] [5] and system restore points [1] [7] [8].

                            Introduced with Windows Server 2003 [1], VSS facilitates backups and system restores without needing to take applications offline [1].
                            It creates a consistent snapshot of data for backup, supporting functions like archiving, data mining, and disk-to-disk backups [1].
                            These snapshots can restore data in case of data loss, to the original location or a new one, if the original has failed [1].

                            However, VSS has privacy and security risks:

                            - It can store unencrypted versions of files, even after users have encrypted and securely deleted them  [5] [7].
                            This feature, while useful for recovery, poses a risk as it allows retrieving deleted files,
                            undermining efforts to permanently remove sensitive information.
                            - Malware may use this service for persistence [4].
                            - Forensic investigators use shadow copies to recover deleted files and analyze your behavior [5].

                            Disabling VSS can also free up system resources and potentially improve performance by eliminating the creation and storage of shadow copies.
                            But it will render system restore points [1] [8] and Windows Backup [1] features inoperative, potentially compromising data recovery capabilities.
                            This trade-off between privacy/security and system recovery features should be carefully considered.

                            > **Caution**:
                            > Disabling this service will make shadow copies unavailable for backup, which could cause backup processes to fail [3].
                            > Services that depend on VSS will not start, affecting features like Windows Server Backup [1], Shadow Copies of Shared Folders [1],
                            > System Center Data Protection Manager [1], and System Restore [1] [8].

                docs: |-
                    This category addresses privacy risks related to the **Snipping Tool** [1] [2]
                    (also called **screen capture** [3]) and its earlier forms, **Snip & Sketch** [1] [4]
                    and **Screen Sketch** [4].

                    The Snipping Tool enables users to capture screenshots [2] [5] and record their screens [2].
                    This capability can expose sensitive information displayed on the screen unintentionally.

                    Earlier versions had significant privacy vulnerabilities, allowing recovery of cropped
                    screenshot portions [6] [7].
                    For example, bank details edited out of a saved screenshot could still be extracted by
                    malicious entities [6].
                    Although updates have remedied these issues in modern versions [6], the potential for
                    data exposure remains a concern.

                    Disabling this tool enhances privacy by preventing unintentional capture of sensitive
                    information and protecting against vulnerabilities.

                            This script removes the outdated **Snipping Tool** app.
                            It was previously known as **Snip & Sketch** [1] [2] [3].

                            It allows users to capture, edit, and share screenshots [3].

                            In recent Windows versions, this app is part of the *Windows Feature Experience Pack*
                            (`MicrosoftWindows.Client.Core`) and is no longer a separate application [4] [5] [6] [7].
                            This script disables snipping functionality on older Windows versions.
                            privacy.sexy does not remove the entire Windows Feature Experience Pack,
                            as it contains many other essential functions [7].

                            This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1] [2].

                            The script modifies the `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\TabletPC!DisableSnippingTool` [1] [2]
                            registry key, preventing the tool from launching [1] [2] [3] and disabling the print screen

                            After running this script, any attempt to open the Snipping Tool will show this message [4],
                            confirming its deactivation (tested on Windows 11 and 10):

                            This script does not affect the new Snipping Tool in Windows 11, only the store app version.

                            This script disables the **Windows logo key** + **Shift** + **S** keyboard shortcut.

                            This keyboard shortcut by default launches the Snipping Tool to capture screenshots [1] [2].
                            During the screenshot process, the screen darkens to indicate the selected area [1].

                            By preventing Windows Explorer from recognizing this keyboard shortcut [3], the script enhances privacy by
                            reducing the risk of unintended data exposure through screenshots.

                            This script also disables the **Windows logo key** + **S** keyboard shortcut [4], which by default
                            activates search functions on Windows [5].

                            > **Caution**: Due to limitation of configuring disabled keys on Windows [6],

                            This script prevents the Print Screen key from launching the Snipping Tool.

                            This is the default Windows behavior starting from Windows 11 22H2 [1].

                            The script targets the `HKCU\Control Panel\Keyboard\PrintScreenKeyForSnippingEnabled` registry key.
                            This key toggles the setting "Use the Print screen button to open screen snipping" in the control panel [1] [2] [3].
                            Changing this setting through the user interface also modifies this registry entry [3].
                            This key is absent by default in modern Windows versions, confirmed through testing starting with Windows
                            10 22H2 and Windows 11 22H3, which indicates that the Print Screen shortcut is enabled.

                            Applying these changes requires restarting File Explorer (`explorer.exe`) [3].
                            Both `explorer.exe` [4] and `Taskbar.dll` [5] reads this configuration at startup.

            It immediately terminates a specified process whenever it starts.
            The function adds `Debugger` registry value to point to the `taskkill.exe` utility, a command-line tool used for terminating processes.
            This effectively means that every time the process attempts to start, `taskkill.exe` is invoked instead, leading to the immediate termination of the process.

        name: UninstallNonRemovableStoreAppWithCleanup # ❗️ Prefer `UninstallNonRemovableStoreApp` for new scripts
        # 💡 Purpose:
        #   This function is designed for comprehensive cleanup, removing the store app along with associated data such as installation directories, user data, and metadata.
        #
        #   It is maintained primarily for backward compatibility, supporting users who need to reverse changes made by earlier versions of privacy.sexy scripts that included app data removal.
        #   Historically, due to limitations in uninstalling non-removable apps through Windows package management tools (like `Remove-AppxPackage`), earlier versions of privacy.sexy scripts
        #   relied on a soft-deletion approach for app data. Newer scripts can now effectively use Windows package management to remove such apps.
        #
        #   For general usage in new scripts, prefer `UninstallNonRemovableStoreApp`. It offers a simpler, safer, and less invasive approach. The extensive cleanup performed by
        #   this function is typically unnecessary for most users.

        #   This allows for easier restoration and less immediate disruption compared to permanent deletion.
        # 🤓 Implementation:
        #   1. (with `grantPermissions`:) Elevate script privileges.
        #   2. Iterate every file in the given directory, and for each file:

                #                because `Get-ScheduledTask `sometimes fails.

                # Considerations for using `Get-Acl` and `Set-Acl`:
                #   These commands may encounter issues when the user lacks "List Folder" permissions on a parent directory, which is essential for the `DeleteGlob` function.
                #   This is robustly handled by `takeown`.
                #     `takeown` effectively handles scenarios where the user lacks "List Folder" permissions.
                #     It requires a localized 'yes' flag, which varies with the system language ('y' for English).
                #     To find the localized 'yes', the script uses the `choice` command. This approach is simpler and more reliable
                #     than parsing `takeown /?`, which has proven to be inconsistent across different languages.

            This function disables specific hotkeys that combine the Windows key with another key.

            Windows Explorer registers nearly two dozen such combinations as global hotkeys, primarily
            for taskbar-related functionalities [1].
            Although these settings are not extensively documented [1], they are acknowledged by Microsoft [2].

            The function modifies the registry key `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer!DisabledHotkeys` [1] [3] [4].
            The specified alphabetical character must be provided in uppercase for the registry data [1].
            This adjustment requires a restart of the explorer process (`explorer.exe`) [3] [5] or a system restart [4].

            > **Caution**:
            > Disabling a character will block all hotkey combinations that use it [1] [4].
            > For example, disabling "V" affects both `Win-V` and `Win-Shift-V` [1] [4].

            This function disables the specified TLS protocol by modifying the registry
            settings under the `SCHANNEL\Protocols` subkey [1] [2] [3] [4].

            This action prevents the Windows operating system from using the protocol during
            SSL/TLS communications, enhancing system security by eliminating older or less secure
            protocols that might be susceptible to attacks.

            The function executes several commands to update the Windows registry.
            It sets `Enabled` and `DisabledByDefault` for both `Server` and `Client` configurations
            as recommended in various security guidelines [1] [2] [3] [4].

            This function enables of specific TLS protocols by modifying registry entries at
            `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols` [1] [2].

            By setting the `DisabledByDefault` registry key to `0`, the it enables the system to negotiate
            the use of protocols that might otherwise not be used by default [1].

            By setting the `Enabled` registry key to '1', it explicitly allows the use of the protocol [1], overriding
            any system defaults that might otherwise prohibit its use [3].

            On reverting the changes, it deletes the registry values, effectively restoring the original protocol settings.
            The default Windows installation does not include values under the `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols`
            registry subtree, as confirmed by tests on Windows 10 22H2 Pro and Windows 11 23H2 Pro.

            This function  configuresregistry settings specifically for .NET Framework applications by setting values within the Windows Registry
            at the `HKLM\SOFTWARE\[Wow6432Node\]Microsoft\.NETFramework\<VERSION>\{{ valueName }}!{{ valueData }}` keys [1] [2] [3].

            It affects the following .NET Framework versions:

            - `v4.0.30319`: Used for configurations pertaining to .NET Framework 4 and later versions [1] [2] [3].
            - `v2.0.50727`: Targets .NET Framework 3.5 settings [1] [3].

            Note that there are no version-based keys such as `v3.0` or `v3.5`, ensuring that only recognized versions are configured.

            The `Wow6432Node` within the registry path indicates compatibility adjustments for 32-bit applications running on 64-bit machines
            it is absent in purely 32-bit environments [4].

            These settings are applied globally, affecting all .NET applications on the system.
            The configurations include enabling features or protocols that might not be active by default, depending on the framework version.

            It configures settings globally, affecting all .NET applications [1].

            When reverting changes, the function removes the specified keys to restore settings to their original state.
            On standard Windows installations, no other subkeys exist under the `.NETFramework\{version}\` registry path besides
            `v4.0.30319\AspNetEnforceViewStateMac!AspNetEnforceViewStateMac` [3], as tested since Windows 10 Pro 22H2 and Windows 11 23H2 Pro.
