                            Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft that is used to develop software [1].
                            Visual Studio store data such as your usage of the software and also information about your hardware [2].
                            The data is stored both in Microsoft cloud [3] and locally on computer.
                            These scripts allow you to delete the local data that might reveal your personally identifiable data about you
                            or the way you use the product.

                                            SQM files are text files that are created and used by Microsoft [1].
                                            SQM stands for "Service Quality Monitoring" [1].

                                            When unable to connect to internet Visual Studio stores SQM files in `%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\VSCommon\<vs_version>\SQM` [2].
                                            The number of files grows continuously and it can get to thousands. Cleaning these files speeds up Visual
                                            Studio significantly according to community reports [2].

                            `VSCEIP` collects information about errors, computer hardware, and how people use Visual Studio [1].
                            The information is sent to Microsoft servers for further analysis.

                            This was previously known as Customer Experience Improvement Program (`PerfWatson`) for Visual Studio
                            that primarily collected your personal usage and related performance data [2].

                            For more information about the information collected, processed, or transmitted by the `VSCEIP`, see the
                            [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement).

                            Visual Studio uses different keys based on CPU architecture of the host operating system (32bit or 64bit) [1]:

                            - 32bit: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VSCommon`
                            - 64bit: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\VSCommon`
                        
                            Key `OptIn` can have two different values [1]:

                            - `0` is opted out (turn off)
                            - `1` is opted in (turn on)

                            The default installation sets the key as `1` (opt-in by default) since Visual Studio 2022.

                            [IntelliCode for Visual Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/intellicode/intellicode-visual-studio) provides AI based
                            suggestions for the code.
                            
                            IntelliCode does not send any code to Microsoft servers as long as team completion model training is not used [1] [2]. This script opts-out
                            from it without breaking the functionality of IntelliCode for local models.

                            The registry keys set by this script do not exist by default after installation since Visual Studio 2022.

                        name: Increase RSA key exchange to 2048-bit
                        docs: |-
                            In 2012, Microsoft began transitioning minimum RSA key length across various applications from 1024 to 2048 bits.
                            1024-Bit key exchange algorithms are still supported in Windows despite being considered deprecated for some time.
                            NIST 800-131A Rev. 2 cites RSA Key Agreement and Key Transport schemes with len(n) < 2048 are disallowed. Generally,
                            RSA 2048-bit+ key exchange algorithms are widely supported. While supported cipher suites remain a roundabout way to
                            address supported key exchange algorithms, these can also be specified independently (although there are still constraints
                            based on negotiated cipher suite) and provide a supplemental baseline to enforce using strong cryptography.

                            This script works by creating the non-default key and value called PKCS at
                            `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\KeyExchangeAlgorithms\` with a name of `ClientMinKeyBitLength`
                            and value of `0x00000800` (2048). The revert deletes the `ClientMinKeyBitLength` value.

                            This script disables marking file attachments by using their zone information.

                            The default behavior is for Windows to mark file attachments with their zone information [1].
                            The zone information of the origin describe whether the file was downloaded from internet,
                            intranet, local, or restricted zone [1].

                            It is used by Attachment Manager that is included in Windows to help protect the computer from
                            unsafe attachments that can be recieved with e-mail message or downloaded from Internet [2].
                            If the Attachment Manager identifies an attachment that might be unsafe, it prevents you from
                            opening the file, or it warns you before you open the file [2].

                            Preventing this information to be saved:
                            - Increases privacy by no longer leaking information of source.
                            - Decreases security by preventing Windows to determine risks and take risk-based actions [1].
                            By not preserving the zone information, Windows cannot make proper risk assessments [3].
                            Disabling it has **Significant** criticality as the configuration introduces additional attack
                            surface according to US government [4].

                            The Attachment Manager feature warns users when opening or executing files which are marked as
                            being from an untrusted source, unless/until the file's zone information has been removed via
                            the "Unblock" button on the file's properties or via a separate tool such as
                            [Microsoft Sysinternals Streams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/streams) [4].

                            It is configured using `SaveZoneInformation` value in
                            `\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Attachments\` registry subkey [1] [2] [3] [4].

                            The value is this setting is confusing, according to Microsoft documentation
                            `1` turns it on [2] [3], `2` turns it off [2] [3]. However, according to STIG V-63841, `1` disables
                            saving zone information and `2` enables it [3]. According to my tests, the STIG interprets it right
                            and `1` disables this function off.

                            In clean Windows 10 and 11 installations, this key by default is missing for both `HKCU` and `HKLM`.

                            Prevents Windows from calling the registered antivirus programs when file attachments are opened [1] [2].

                            Windows registered antivirus programs for downloaded files from Internet or through e-mail attachments [1].
                            If multiple programs are registered, they will all be notified [1] [3].
                            This is disabled by default, so even if you do not configure run this script, Windows does not call the registered
                            antivirus programs when file attachments are opened [1].

                            If it is enabled, Windows blocks file from being opened when antivirus program fails [1]. It is the recommended setting
                            by Microsoft [1].

                            Preventing calling antivirus:
                            - Increases privacy by not sharing your file data proactively with installed antiviruses.
                            - Decreases by detecting and mitigating potential malicious software. Disabling it has **Moderate**
                            criticality as it is not an appropriate antivirus configuration according to US government [4].
                            
                            An updated antivirus program must be installed for this policy setting to function properly [4].

                            It is configured using `ScanWithAntiVirus` value in
                            `\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Attachments\` registry subkey [1] [2] [3] [4].
                            `3` enables the scans [1] [2] [3], `1` disables it [1] [3], and `2` leaves it optional [1].

                            In clean Windows 10 and 11 installations, this key by default comes with `3` value in
                            `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Attachments\ScanWithAntiVirus`,
                            and key is missing for `HKCU`.

                Microsoft OneDrive (formerly SkyDrive) is a file hosting service operated by Microsoft [1].
                First launched in August 2007, it enables registered users to share and synchronize their files [1].

                Data stored on OneDrive is subject to monitoring by Microsoft [2].
                There's been reports of Microsoft accessing and altering your personal files when syncing on OneDrive [3] [4].

                Uninstalling OneDrive is recommended by Microsoft to optimize Windows VDIs [5].

                        Scheduled tasks for OneDrive handle maintainence tasks such as auto-updates and data reporting.
                        These tasks are left intact even after successful uninstall.

                        Windows 10 and 11 comes with two tasks named:
                        1. `OneDrive Standalone Update Task`
                        2. `OneDrive Reporting Task`

                        Both tasks are enabled by default. They are not documented officially either on Microsoft's website
                        or inside Task Scheduler itself through any description. But one could find these tasks by running:
                        `Get-ScheduledTask 'OneDrive *' |  Select -ExpandProperty TaskName`.
                        
                        The tasks are named accordingly:

                        - OneDrive Reporting Task-S-1-5-21-994346235-3805487047-77196597-500
                        - OneDrive Standalone Update Task-S-1-5-21-994346235-3805487047-77196597-500
                        - OneDrive Standalone Update Task-S-1-5-21-2040720125-3302134200-1644992326-500

                        The SID number (after `-`) changes per installation. SID of user accounts always start with `S-1-5-21` [1]
                        so these are users. You can see all user accounts by running `wmic useraccount get Name,sid`, and you will
                        find out that the first SID used belongs to your account (can verify using `whoami /user`). The other SID
                        used does not belong to any user account even though it starts with `S-1-5-21`. It may be caused by
                        `sysprep` behavior where it will use different SID for scheduled tasks to avoid duplication [2].

                        Third SID is unpredictable but also impossible to disable. Disabling using `schtasks` would result in:
                        `schtasks : ERROR: Catastrophic failure`. You can try using:

                        ```ps1
                            $tasks=$(
                                Get-ScheduledTask 'OneDrive Reporting Task-*'
                                Get-ScheduledTask 'OneDrive Standalone Update Task-*'
                            )
                            foreach ($task in $tasks) {
                                $fullPath = $task.TaskPath + $task.TaskName
                                Write-Host "Disabling `"$fullPath`""
                                schtasks /Change /TN "$fullPath" /DISABLE
                            }
                        ```

                        Even disabling this using Task Scheduler UI shows "Catastrophic failure (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80000FFF (E_UNEXPECTED))".
                        
                        Disabling tasks with user SID works fine, you can test it using (run as .bat file, not directly on terminal):

                        ```batchfile
                            @echo off
                            for /f "tokens=1,2 delims==" %%s IN ('wmic path win32_useraccount where name^='%username%' get sid /value ^| find /i "SID"') do (
                                set "User_SID=%%t"
                            )
                            schtasks /Change /TN "\OneDrive Standalone Update Task-%User_SID%" /DISABLE
                            schtasks /Change /TN "\OneDrive Reporting Task-%User_SID%" /DISABLE
                        ```

                        Deleting tasks works fine so this script will delete all these tasks instead.

                docs: |-
                    Windows 11 adds a new taskbar flyout named "Widgets", which displays a panel with Microsoft Start, a news aggregator
                    with personalized stories and content (expanding upon the "news and interests" panel introduced in later builds of Windows 10) [1]. 
                    It's rebranding/future version of older "Windows 10 News and Interests" feature [2].
                    The user can customize the panel by adding or removing widgets, rearranging, resizing, and personalizing the content [1].

                    It has privacy implications as it collects data about your usage of the computer such as diagnostics data [3].

                            To control whether the Widgets button is visible on the taskbar, Microsoft introduced `TaskbarDa` registry value [1].
                            Possible `DWORD` 32-bit settings for the `TaskbarDa` value are [1] [2]:

                            1. 0 = Hidden
                            2. 1 = Visible

                            This registry key does not exist in Windows 11 installations by default.
