                docs: |-
                    This category includes scripts that erase traces of recent user activities on Windows.
                    These scripts enhance privacy by removing records of accessed files, used applications, and changed
                    system settings.

                    Clearing recent activity is crucial for protecting your privacy.
                    Your computer keeps detailed logs of your actions, creating a digital footprint that can reveal
                    sensitive information about your habits, interests, and personal life.
                    This data can be exploited by cybercriminals, aggressive marketers, or even used in legal proceedings.

                    Regularly clearing this information helps you control your privacy and reduces the risk of personal.
                    It also protects you from malicious actors who may insert harmful items into your activity history [4].

                    **Key Benefits:**

                    - **Enhances privacy:** Removes records that reveal personal usage patterns, habits, and preferences.
                    - **Safeguards information:** Helps protect sensitive information from unauthorized access and analysis.
                    - **Improves security:** Limits the information and attack surface available to potential attackers.
                    - **Boosts performance:** Improves system performance slightly by reducing unnecessary data.

                    > **Caution:**
                    > Clearing recent activity may affect your productivity by removing quick access to recently used
                    > files, applications, and settings.

                        category: Clear Quick Access lists
                        docs: |-
                            This category focuses on managing Jump Lists in Windows.
                            This feature was first introduced with Windows 7 in July 2009 and has been included in subsequent versions [1] [2] [3].
                            These lists are found in the Start Menu or Taskbar and provide quick access to recently opened files and folders [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].

                            The privacy concern with Jump Lists is their detailed recording of user activities. They store data such as file names, directory paths,
                            MAC (Modified, Accessed, Created) timestamps, network information, volume names, and file sizes [2] [3] [4] [6]. This information is
                            utilized in forensic analysis to reveal user behavior and interactions with the system [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]. Authorities frequently examine
                            these files for investigative purposes [3].

                            Clearing these Jump Lists is crucial for maintaining privacy. It helps remove traces of user activities, particularly those involving
                            personal or confidential files. By doing so, users prevent the easy accessibility of their activity history, an important privacy measure
                            since these records can persist long after the original files and applications are deleted [3] [5].

                            > **Caution:** Clearing Quick Access lists may disrupt your workflow by removing shortcuts to frequently accessed files and folders.

                                    This script clears the `AutomaticDestinations` Jump List files in Windows.
                                    It improves user privacy by removing traces of recent file and application usage.

                                    These files are automatically created when a user opens a file or an application [1].
                                    They help users quickly access recently or frequently used items, usually via the Windows taskbar [2].
                                    They are hidden and do not appear in Windows Explorer [3].
                                    The files are located in `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations` [2] [3] [4].
                                    These files are identified by the `automaticDestinations-ms` extension [3].

                                    However, these files also record detailed user activity, such as timestamps, file locations, network information, and usage frequency [1] [3] [4] [5].
                                    They store comprehensive data including boot session times, sequence numbers, user directories, and MAC addresses of network cards [1] [5].
                                    Web search strings from browsers like Edge, Firefox, Chrome, and Opera, used by Cortana, are also stored in these files [3].

                                    By clearing these files, the script not only removes the history of user activity but also reduces the risk of this data being analyzed to
                                    construct user activity timelines [1]. Such analysis could potentially expose personal usage patterns and behaviors, compromising privacy.

                                    > **Caution:**
                                    > Clearing recent files will remove the convenience of quickly accessing recently used files and folders.

                                    This script removes `CustomDestinations` Jump List files in Windows.

                                    These files are hidden [1] and located in `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\CustomDestinations` [1] [2] [3].

                                    `CustomDestinations` files are created by different applications to enable users to pin items
                                    such as tasks and files or applications.
                                    This includes tasks like opening a new browser window or creating a new spreadsheet [2], as well
                                    as files and applications frequently used [3] [4].
                                    They are commonly used by web browsers and media players to store a user's web history and other activities [1].

                                    The privacy concern arises because these files not only record pinned items but also store detailed data
                                    about user interactions. This includes
                                    file opening, modification, and access times, along with the full directory path and volume information [3] [4].
                                    Such information, if accessed, may reveal personal habits and preferences [1] [2] [3].

                                    Clearing these files prevents the potential use of this data in reconstructing a user's activity history, which is
                                    particularly sensitive when it involves personal or confidential information.
                                    The script thus plays a crucial role in maintaining the confidentiality and privacy of the user's digital activities.

                            This category focuses on removing specific types of usage data from the Windows Registry
                            to enhance privacy and improve system performance.
                            
                            The Windows Registry is a hierarchical database that stores settings, configurations, and
                            options for the operating system, installed applications, and user preferences [1].
                            It's like a central storage system for Windows and its programs.
                            As users interact with their system and software, usage data and traces accumulate in the registry.

                            This information is often used for forensic analysis to study user behavior or by attackers to
                            gather data about individuals [2].
                            Clearing non-essential registry usage data improves privacy by reducing the amount of personal
                            information available to potential threats.

                            By removing unnecessary data, this process may also contribute to optimizing
                            system performance by reducing registry size and complexity.

                                    The Windows Registry Editor (`regedit`) allows users to save frequently
                                    accessed registry locations as favorites [1].
                                    This information is typically used by forensic analysts to study your behavior [2].

                                    Clearing these favorites removes traces of your commonly accessed registry
                                    locations, enhancing your privacy.
                                    It may also improve system performance by reducing unnecessary data in the registry.

                            When you open or save an image file in Paint (`mspaint.exe`), it adds the image to the
                            **File > Recent pictures** history list [1].
                            This list provides quick access to recently used files but also creates a record of your

                            The Paint registry keys are created only after you use the application [2].

                            These keys store information such as:

                            - File names of recently opened images [2]

                            This information can be used to:

                            - Provide evidence in forensic investigations to study your behavior [2]

                            By clearing this list, you:

                            - Enhance your privacy by removing traces of your Paint activity
                            - Reduce the risk of others seeing your recently edited images

                            This script removes the most recently used (MRU) file list from WordPad, enhancing user privacy.

                            WordPad stores the names and paths of recently opened files [1] [2].
                            Unlike Microsoft Office Word, WordPad doesn't offer a built-in feature to clear this list [1].
                            This data can be used in forensic investigations to analyze user behavior [1].

                            The stored information includes:

                            - **File Name:** The name of the file opened in WordPad [1] [2]
                            - **File Path:** The complete path to the file [1]
                            - **File Modified Date/Time:** When the MRU registry key was last changed [1]
                            - **Registry or MRU Order:** The order of file access, with `1` being the most recent [1]
                            - **Value Name:** The record's associated value in the registry key [1]

                            The recent files list updates only when the WordPad application is closed [1].

                            WordPad is removed from all editions of Windows starting with Windows 11, version 24H2 [3].
                            Therefore, this script may not apply to the latest Windows versions.

                            This script deletes all registry values under the
                            `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Applets\Wordpad\Recent File List` registry key [1] [2].
                            By doing so, it removes traces of your recent WordPad activity, improving your privacy.

                            This script removes the history of mapped network drives from your system.

                            Windows allows users to map network drives, which assigns a drive letter to a shared folder on a remote system [1].
                            This makes accessing shared resources easier, as if they were local drives.
                            When you map a network drive, Windows stores information about it [1].

                            These stored details includes:

                            - The network path (UNC) of the mapped drive [1]
                            - When the drive was last accessed [1]
                            - Other mapped drive paths [1]

                            While convenient, this stored information may pose privacy risks.
                            Forensic analysts often use these artifacts to study user behavior and uncover network activity [1].

                            By clearing this data, you can:

                            - Protect your privacy by removing traces of network resources you've accessed
                            - Potentially improve system performance by reducing Registry clutter

                            This data includes search terms and dates [1] [2] [4] [5].
                            It's used in forensic analysis to study user behavior [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6].

                            Clearing search history improves privacy by removing this potentially sensitive information.
                            It may also improve system performance by freeing up storage space.

                            > **Caution:** Clearing search history may affect your ability to quickly find recently searched items.

                            ### Technical Details

                            The script enhances privacy by deleting this tracking information from the following locations:

                            - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Search Assistant\ACMru\*` [1] [3] [6]:
                              Used by Windows XP [1] [3].
                              It stores search history in subkeys [6] [6].
                              This location is not used in newer Windows versions [1] [3].
                            - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\WordWheelQuery` [1] [2] [3] [5]:
                              Used by Windows 7 and later versions [1] [2] [3] [5],
                              including Windows 10 [2] [5] and 11 [5] to store search history.
                            - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\SearchHistory` [3] [4]:
                              Used by Windows 8 and later for search history [3] [4].
                              Windows 8 utilizes `Microsoft.Windows.FileSearchApp` sub key [4].
                            - `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\ConnectedSearch\History` folder [3] [4].
                              This directory is used by Windows 8.1 to store search history [3] [4].

                            This script enhances privacy by removing traces of recently accessed files and folders from the Windows system.

                            Windows automatically tracks and stores information about files and folders accessed by users [1] [2].
                            This data is maintained in various registry keys and includes details such as file names, types,
                            access dates, and full paths [1] [2] [3] [4].
                            This information persists even after the original files or folders are deleted [1] [4].

                            This data is commonly used for forensic analysis to study your behavior [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].
                            It can reveal user activities, including access to sensitive or unauthorized documents [1] [2] [3].
                            This information provides insights into user behavior and file interactions across different applications [2].

                            To protect your privacy, this script deletes tracking information from these locations:

                            - `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RecentDocs\<Extension>` [1] [2] [5]
                              for Windows XP [2] and Vista [1] [2].

                            This script clears the recent activity history in Windows Media Player.

                            Windows Media Player automatically stores files and URLs you recently played for easy access
                            through the history list [1] [2].
                            It also stores recently added radio station entries [3].
                            This data can be exploited by attackers to gather information about you [2] [4].

                            The script improves privacy by removing traces of your media consumption habits.
                            It may also enhance system performance by clearing unnecessary data.

                            This script mimics the **Tools > Privacy > Clear History** option in Windows Media Player 9 and 10 [1].

                            The script deletes all registry values under:

                            - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\MediaPlayer\Player\RecentFileList` [1] [2] [4]
                            - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\MediaPlayer\Player\RecentURLList` [1] [2] [4]
                            - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\MediaPlayer\Radio\MRUList` [3]

                            This data is recreated when you open a file in Media Player [1].
                            For continuous privacy protection, run this cleanup regularly.

                            > **Caution:**
                            > Running this script may temporarily disrupt quick access to your recently played media files,
                            > URLs, and radio stations in Windows Media Player.

                            This script removes the most recent application usage data stored by DirectX to enhance privacy.

                            DirectX is a set of Windows components that helps software (often games and multimedia applications) 
                            to work directly with video and audio hardware [1].
                            It logs the most recent application data in the system registry [2].
                            Attackers exploit this information to gather insights about a target's system or network [3].
                            Forensic analysts use this information to study your behavior [4].

                            This script enhances your privacy by removing traces of the last DirectX applications or games you have used.
                            It can also improve system performance by freeing up system resources.

                            This script deletes all registry values under the key `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Direct3D\MostRecentApplication` [2] [3] [4].

                            > **Caution:** This action may slightly impact DirectX's ability to optimize performance for recently used applications.

                            Windows Run utility [1] [6], and Windows Run window [1].

                            You can access it by:

                            - Pressing **Windows logo key + R** [1] [3]
                            - Searching for **Run** in the **Start Menu** [1] [2]
                            - Running specific commands:
                              - `explorer shell:::{2559a1f3-21d7-11d4-bdaf-00c04f60b9f0}` [4]
                              - `SYSTEMROOT%\System32\rundll32.exe shell32.dll,#61` [4]

                            Keeping this data poses privacy and security risks:

                            - It reveals user activity on the system, including accessed files and applications [1] [5] [6]
                            - Forensic analysts use this data to study user behavior [1] [5] [6]
                            - Attackers use this data to understand user activities or execute malicious code [5]

                            Clearing this data improves your privacy and security by:

                            - Removing traces of your recent activities
                            - Preventing third parties from gaining insights into your system usage
                            - Reducing the risk of malicious code execution via manipulated data entries

                            It can also improve system performance by reducing the amount of data Windows needs to process when accessing the Run dialog history.

                            This script deletes all registry values under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RunMRU` [1] [5] [6].

                            To ensure the changes take effect, close and reopen the Run window if it's currently open [1].

                            > **Caution**:
                            > This script will erase your Run command history, potentially slowing down access to frequently used programs and files.

                            This script clears the history of paths you've typed in the File Explorer address bar.

                            Windows stores recent paths entered in File Explorer [1] [2] [3] (formerly known as Windows Explorer [1] [2]).
                            This specifically targets paths that have been manually typed into the Address Bar [2] [3].
                            These can be file or folder locations [2].
                            Windows saves up to 25 of these entries [1].
                            The paths are saved upon closing the File Explorer window [1].

                            This stored data includes:

                            - Full path typed [1] [2]
                            - Date and time of entry [1] [2]

                            This information may pose privacy and security risks:

                            - Reveals your file access history [1] [2]
                            - Allows tracking of when and how often files were accessed [1] [2]
                            - Enables detection of activity patterns, such as specific application use [2]
                            - Can be used to build a timeline of user actions [2]
                            - Can be exploited by malware to maintain persistence on the system [4]
                            - Can be used by attackers to map system structure or track behavior
                            - Facilitates social engineering attacks based on file access patterns

                            This data is often used in forensic investigations [1] [2].
                            This data can be used in investigations related to intellectual property theft, employee misconduct,
                            security breaches, or other criminal activities [2].

                            This script enhances privacy by:

                            - Removing traces of your file system navigation
                            - Reducing unauthorized access risk to your browsing history
                            - Limiting data available for forensic analysis
                            - Preventing exposure of sensitive file or folder names
                            - Reducing risk of attacks based on file access patterns
                            - Minimizing digital footprint on shared or public computers
                            - Protecting against certain types of malware
                            - Maintaining confidentiality of work or personal projects

                            It can also slightly improve system performance by freeing up space and reducing the data
                            Windows processes when accessing File Explorer history.

                            This script deletes all registry values under:
                            `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\TypedPaths` [1] [2] [3].
                            This subkey includes values named `url1`, `url2`, `url3`, etc., with `url1` always containing the most recent typed path [1].

                            > **Caution**:
                            > This script may impair your ability to quickly access recently typed file paths in File Explorer,
                            > potentially affecting your workflow efficiency.

                            Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft that is used to develop software [1].
                            Visual Studio store data such as your usage of the software and also information about your hardware [2].
                            The data is stored both in Microsoft cloud [3] and locally on computer.
                            These scripts allow you to delete the local data that might reveal your personally identifiable data about you
                            or the way you use the product.

                                            This script removes offline telemetry data in Visual Studio to enhance privacy and potentially
                                            improve system performance.

                                            These telemetry files, known as SQM (*Service Quality Monitoring* or *Software Quality Metrics* [2]),
                                            contain details about application usage, errors, and performance [1].
                                            SQM files are created and used by Microsoft to gather data for the Microsoft Customer Experience Improvement Program [2].
                                            When offline, Visual Studio stores these files in the user's local application data folder [3].
                                            
                                            Removing these files helps protect user privacy by deleting usage data.
                                            Removing this data may improve Visual Studio's performance, as the accumulation of these files can potentially slow
                                            down the application [3].

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            Visual Studio stores these SQM files locally in the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\VSCommon\<Version Number>\SQM` folder [3].
                                            This script removes data for Visual Studio versions 2015 through 2022 [4]:

                                    This category removes locally stored Visual Studio license information to enhance privacy.

                                    Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for writing, editing, debugging, and building code [1].
                                    It offers tools like compilers, code completion, and supports various programming languages and platforms [1].

                                    Visual Studio stores a local copy of your license information [2] [3] [4] [5].
                                    It remains even after uninstalling the software [2].
                                    This applies to both purchased products and free trials [3].

                                    The stored data may include sensitive information such as:

                                    - License expiration date [3] [4]
                                    - License key used to activate your local Visual Studio installation [5]

                                    Removing this information improves your privacy by eliminating potentially revealing data about your software usage
                                    and licensing status.
                                    It may also slightly improve system performance by freeing up storage space used for license data.

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > Removing the license information may require you to reactivate Visual Studio on the next use.
                                    > You will need your license key and Microsoft account details for reactivation.

                                            Visual Studio 2010 is an integrated development environment (IDE) by Microsoft [1].
                                            It simplifies creating, debugging, and deploying applications [1].
                                            It was released in 2010 [2].
                                            Its official support ended in 2015, and extended support ended in October 2020 [2].
                                            This means it's no longer receiving security updates or bug fixes, making it potentially vulnerable.

                                            The script removes the license associated with Visual Studio 2010's product GUID:

                                            This script enhances your privacy by removing identifiable license information from your system.
                                            It may also improve system performance by clearing outdated registry entries.

                                            It introduced roaming support, notifications, improved update experience, and various productivity enhancements [2].

                                            enabled cloud testing, and enhanced team collaboration [2].

                                            Microsoft ended official support for Visual Studio 2013 in April 2019, with extended support ended in April 2024 [3].
                                            This means it no longer receives security updates or bug fixes, potentially making it vulnerable to security risks.

                                            Visual Studio 2013 uses the product GUID `E79B3F9C-6543-4897-BBA5-5BFB0A02BB5C` for license association [3] [4] [5].

                                            Visual Studio 2017 is an integrated development environment (IDE) created by Microsoft [1].
                                            It was released on March 7, 2017 [2] [3].
                                            Visual Studio 2017 focuses on improving performance with a faster, more efficient lightweight
                                            installation process [1].
                                            It enhances cloud and mobile development, providing integrated tools for .NET Core, Azure applications,
                                            Docker containers, and streamlined mobile app creation for Android, iOS, and Windows [1].

                                            Microsoft ended official support for Visual Studio 2017 in April 2022, with extended support ending in April 2027 [4].
                                            This means it no longer receives security updates or bug fixes, potentially exposing users to security risks.

                                            Visual Studio 2017 has a product GUID of `5C505A59-E312-4B89-9508-E162F8150517` to which the license is associated [4] [5] [6].

                                            and more efficient search functionality [1].
                                            It facilitates collaboration through Git-focused workflows and integrated code reviews [1].
                                            The IDE also offers advanced debugging capabilities, including memory optimization and automatic execution snapshots [1].

                                            Microsoft ended mainstream support for Visual Studio 2019 in April 2024,

                                            Visual Studio 2022 is an integrated development environment (IDE) by Microsoft
                                            for software development [1].
                                            It was released on November 8, 2021 [2].

                                            Visual Studio 2022 introduces AI-powered enhancements such as IntelliSense and
                                            IntelliCode for smarter, faster coding, alongside GitHub Copilot for improved
                                            code completion and debugging [1].
                                            It also offers improved productivity with a 64-bit IDE, better cross-platform
                                            development tools, and advanced debugging and testing features [1].

                                            Microsoft's mainstream support for Visual Studio 2022 ends in January 2027, with
                                            extended support until January 2032 [2].

                                            Visual Studio 2022 uses multiple product GUIDs, reflecting the variety of versions and installation
                                            configurations reported by the community [3].

                                    This script deletes recently typed or pasted URLs from Internet Explorer's history.

                                    Internet Explorer stores typed URLs [1] [2] [3] [4].
                                    It enables AutoComplete, which automatically suggests and fills in web addresses as you type [1] [4].
                                    It's also used for populating the URL drop-down menu with previously visited sites [1] [4].

                                    This data includes:

                                    - **Typed URLs:** Web addresses entered in the address bar [4]
                                    - **Typed filepaths:** Files or folders typed on some versions of Internet Explorer [1].
                                    - **Visit dates:** The most recent access time for each entry [3] [4]

                                    While this feature enhances usability, it may compromise privacy:

                                    1. It reveals browsing habits, potentially exposing sensitive information [1].
                                    2. Forensic analysts can use this data to study user web activity [1] [2] [3] [4].
                                    3. Malware may exploit this data to redirect users to malicious sites [2] [5].
                                       For example `Adware.StartPage` malware uses it to generate revenue by increasing website visits [2] [5].

                                    The potential misuse of this data is exemplified by the Julie Amero case [2].
                                    Amero, a substitute teacher, was wrongly convicted based on forensic evidence of typed URLs, despite her
                                    computer being infected with malware generating unwanted pop-ups [2].
                                    This incident underscores the importance of regular privacy maintenance to prevent misinterpretation
                                    of browsing data and protect against unwarranted accusations.

                                    Deleting this data improves privacy by:

                                    - Reducing the risk of unauthorized access to browsing history
                                    - Limiting potential exploitation by malware
                                    - Minimizing digital footprints that could be used for user profiling
                                    - Preventing misinterpretation of browsing data in unforeseen circumstances

                                    This script improves privacy with little downside since Internet Explorer is outdated [6].

                                    This script may also slightly improve system performance by freeing up disk space and
                                    reducing the amount of stored data that Internet Explorer needs to process.

                                    The script removes data from these registry locations:

                                    - `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\TypedURLs` [1] [4] [5]
                                      Values are stored as strings named `url1`, `url2`, etc., with `url1` being the most recent entry [1] [4].
                                    - `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\TypedURLsTime` [3]
                                      Values are stored as strings named `url1`, `url2`, etc., corresponding to the TypedURLs entries [3].

                                    > **Caution:** This action may slow down your browsing in Internet Explorer by removing suggestions
                                    > for previously accessed websites.

                            This category encompasses a series of scripts aimed at helping users manage and delete their browsing history and related data in Mozilla Firefox.

                            The scripts are designed to target different aspects of user data stored by Firefox, providing users options for maintaining privacy and freeing up disk space.

                                    This script targets the Firefox browsing history, including URLs, downloads, bookmarks, and site visits, by deleting specific database entries.

                                    Firefox stores various user data in a file named `places.sqlite`. This file includes:

                                    - Annotations, bookmarks, and favorite icons (`moz_anno_attributes`, `moz_annos`, `moz_favicons`) [1]
                                    - Browsing history, a record of pages visited (`moz_places`, `moz_historyvisits`) [1]
                                    - Keywords and typed URLs (`moz_keywords`, `moz_inputhistory`) [1]
                                    - Item annotations (`moz_items_annos`) [1]
                                    - Bookmark roots such as places, menu, toolbar, tags, unfiled (`moz_bookmarks_roots`) [1]

                                    The `moz_places` table holds URL data, connecting to various other tables like `moz_annos`, `moz_bookmarks`, `moz_inputhistory`, and `moz_historyvisits` [2].
                                    Due to these connections, the script removes entries from all relevant tables simultaneously to maintain database integrity.
                                    
                                    **Bookmarks**: Stored across several tables (`moz_bookmarks`, `moz_bookmarks_folders`, `moz_bookmarks_roots`) [3], with additional undocumented tables like `moz_bookmarks_deleted` [4].

                                    **Downloads**: Stored in the 'places.sqlite' database, within the 'moz_annos' table [5]. The entries in `moz_annos` are linked to `moz_places` that store the actual history entry
                                    (`moz_places.id = moz_annos.place_id`) [6]. Associated URL information is stored within the 'moz_places' table [5]. Downloads have been historically stored in `downloads.rdf` for Firefox 2.x
                                    and below [7], and `downloads.sqlite` later on [7].

                                    **Favicons**: Older Firefox versions stored favicons in `places.sqlite` within the `moz_favicons` table [5], while newer versions use `favicons.sqlite` and the `moz_icons` table [5].

                                    By executing this script, users can ensure their Firefox browsing history, bookmarks, and downloads are thoroughly removed, contributing to a cleaner and more private browsing experience.

                    This category covers removal of temporary Windows files.

                    It is recommended to clean these files as they can be used for unauthorized analysis of user behavior and system usage [1].
                    They may also potentially host malicious software [2] [3].
                    Eliminating these files significantly enhances the security and privacy of the system.

                    Microsoft advises this cleanup for enhanced security [2]. Besides enhancing security, removing these files also frees up disk space.
                    However, removing temporary files might lead to a slight delay in initial application/system load times.

                    By regularly clearing these files, users reduce the chance of malware residing [2] [3] in these folders and prevent the unauthorized
                    use of their information for forensic analysis [1], serving as a simple and effective strategy for maintaining a secure and private system environment.

                            This script eliminates the contents of the `%SYSTEMROOT%\Temp\` directory, also known as the Windows Temp directory [1].
                            This directory is located within the Windows system folder `%SystemDrive%\Windows\Temp\` [1] [2].
                            It is used by the system and system-level processes to store temporary files, including those generated by the operating
                            system and other system-level software.

                            This folder, protected by specific access control lists (ACL) [3] [4], is accessible only to system-level accounts [2].

                            Known for being utilized by malware, cleaning this directory is recommended for maintaining system security [2] [5]. Moreover,
                            it's used for forensics to analyze user behavior [6], thus raising privacy concerns.

                            Microsoft underscores the importance of cleaning this folder to free up disk space [7], resolve system application issues [1] [8] [9],
                            and counteract malware [2]. Some system applications may populate this folder, taking up considerable disk space [7] [9] [10].

                            This script only deletes the contents of the `%SYSTEMROOT%\Temp\` directory, not the directory itself, to maintain system integrity,
                            security, and privacy, avoiding potential issues caused by unintentional directory deletion without proper ACL. Deleting the directory
                            itself might disrupt certain applications, such as `dism` [11], and application installers [12], while also removing the special ACL
                            that secures the folder.

                            This folder's usage for understanding user behavior in forensics [5] raises privacy concerns. Its content deletion, a regular operation performed
                            by Windows system tools like SilentCleanup (`cleanmgr.exe`) or Storage Sense (`storsvc.exe`) [8], does not harm the system. On cloud machines,
                            Microsoft does not retain contents of this directory and conducts automatic clean-ups to prevent data accumulation [6].

                            This script, while removing the contents, retains the directory to preserve the access control list (ACL) assigned by Microsoft [7], preventing potential
                            misconfigurations due to unintentional folder creation without proper ACL.

                            Microsoft recommends cleaning this folder to free disk space [8] and eliminate potential malware [9].

                            Post-script execution, a reboot is recommended to ensure smooth application functionality accessing `%TEMP%` [8].

                            This script deletes the contents of `%SYSTEMROOT%\Prefetch\*`, typically pointing to `C:\Windows\Prefetch\` [1] [2].

                            **What is Prefetch?**

                            Introduced in Windows XP [2], Prefetch was developed by Windows to expedite application startup [1] and the boot process [1] [2].
                            It works by preemptively loading data and code pages into memory from the disk before requests [2], monitoring application's startup
                            page faults [2], and storing the gathered data in the Prefetch directory [2].

                            **Why Clear the Prefetch Directory?**

                            Over time, many files accumulate in the Prefetch directory. Clearing this directory enhances privacy and potentially frees disk space
                            by removing traces of recently used applications and files in the system, making unauthorized tracking of application usage more difficult.
                            Despite its design for improving application startup times [1], Prefetch can inadvertently expose information about the applications and files
                            accessed on the system [1]. Clearing the Prefetch directory addresses this issue by eliminating these traces.

                            Microsoft suggests deleting the Prefetch directory and its contents if significant system configuration changes occur, like adjustments to drivers,
                            services, or applications that start automatically [3]. This action eradicates any outdated prefetched data [3], ensuring that the system operates
                            with the most up-to-date and relevant data for application startups [3].

                            The files in the Prefetch directory are used for forensic purposes [4] [5], adding to the privacy concerns. They reveal information about application usage,
                            including data layout [4], access history on disk [4], last execution time [5], and the total number of times an application has been run [5]. Additionally,
                            they contain historical process information such as loaded libraries and process dependencies [6]. Erasing these files mitigates the risk of
                            this information being used for unauthorized tracking or analysis, improving your privacy.

                            **Trade-Off**

                            Clearing the Prefetch might cause a minor delay in application startup times until the necessary data is regenerated as applications are used again [2].
                            This is a compromise for heightened privacy and potentially freed disk space.

                                            These are logs related to Windows Update [1] [2].

                                            It stores event trace log (ETL) files [3].

                                            While the logs are largely technical, like many diagnostic logs, there's a potential for some data that could be considered personally identifiable information
                                            (PII), such as usernames or machine names, to be included.

                                            From a forensic standpoint, they offer valuable data for reconstructing system events related to software updates [3] :

                                            - **Update History**: The logs can provide a history of updates, including those that failed and required remediation. This could be used to establish a timeline of events on a system.
                                            - **System Integrity**: In forensic scenarios where the integrity of the system is in question, the SIH logs could be used to determine if there were any issues with updates, including
                                            any that were automatically remediated.
                                            - **Behavior Analysis**: While the primary purpose of the logs is not to capture user behavior, they can be part of a broader set of logs and data used in behavioral analysis, especially
                                            when reconstructing events leading up to a particular system state or incident.

                                    This action is sometimes called *resetting the Windows Update Agent* or *resetting Windows Update components* by Microsoft [1].

                                    This directory contains Windows Update files [2] [3].
                                    It includes logs of Windows updates [2] [4], downloaded updates [5], and database files related to the updates [2].

                                    Over time, the size of this folder can increase [5], leading to potential disk space issues. Clearing this directory can help free up disk space [5].

                                    This folder is used by Windows Updates [1] [6].
                                    The `wuauserv` service, also known as "Windows Update Service" [7], uses this folder for its operations [1] [8] [9].
                                    This service manages the Windows Update Agent (WUA) functionality [7].

                                    Clearing this directory is generally safe, and sometimes, Microsoft even recommends this action to troubleshoot and resolve update-related
                                    errors [1] [5] [6] [9] [10].

                            This script deletes primary telemetry files in Windows.
                            These files store event trace logs that are collected by the `DiagTrack` service [1] [2].
                            This service is also known as "Diagnostics Tracking Service" [3] or "Connected User Experiences and Telemetry" service [4].

                            These files are stored as Event Trace Log (`.etl`) files, also known as a trace logs [5].
                            Contents of these files are transmitted to Microsoft servers [1] [2].

                            This services uses *AutoLogger* logs.
                            *AutoLogger* allows saving trace logs early in the operating system boot process before the user logs in [6].
                            This data is collected during system boot and shut-down, and typically read and deleted at each system boot [3].

                            The information collected is divided into two files:

                            - `%PROGRAMDATA%\Microsoft\Diagnosis\ETLLogs\AutoLogger\AutoLogger-Diagtrack-Listener.etl` [1] [2]
                            - `%PROGRAMDATA%\Microsoft\Diagnosis\ETLLogs\ShutdownLogger\AutoLogger-Diagtrack-Listener.etl` [1] [2]

                            To modify or delete these files, `SYSTEM` rights are required [1], which this script provides.

                            The collected data varies based on the telemetry level set [2] and may include information about websites visited, application
                            and system performance, device activity, and memory dumps [7].

                            By deleting these telemetry files, this script prevents the `DiagTrack` service from sending a specific set of diagnostic and
                            usage data to Microsoft, enhancing user privacy by reducing data sharing.

                            This script deletes the scan history kept by Microsoft Defender on your computer. Microsoft Defender logs detected threats but also gathers
                            and stores data about various other files it scans [1] [2]. While removing this history enhances your privacy, it might decrease security,
                            as these logs assist in monitoring threats. By eliminating traces of your system's files, activities and any threats detected, you ensure
                            no residual data can be utilized to study or analyze your computer's activities, thus protecting your privacy.

                            Defender keeps a log of various details whenever it scans your computer for threats. This includes [3] [4]:

                            - **Time**: The moment the threat was discovered.
                            - **Threat Status**: The action carried out against the threat.
                            - **Virus Type**: The type or category of the virus.
                            - **Threat ID**: A unique identifier for the threat.
                            - **Virus Name**: The name of the virus.
                            - **File Path**: The location of the threat on your computer.
                            - **File Hash**: A unique code representing the file.
                            - **Quarantine File Name (GUID)**: The name given to the quarantined threat.
                            - **File Size**: The size of the file.

                            When you first set up Windows, it conducts an initial scan [1]. This scan identifies system files that won't require future
                            scans [1]. These 'safe' files are saved in a unique folder, which becomes a part of the scan history [1].

                            If a threat is recognized, Microsoft Defender will notify you [4]. Regardless of whether you choose to run the file or not, a
                            `DetectionHistory` file is created [2]. This file is stored in a specific folder
                            (`%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Scans\History\Service\DetectionHistory\[numbered folder]\`), and it contains a
                            system-generated ID for the event [2].

                            > **Caution:** Deleting these logs may decrease your security. These logs help in keeping track of potential threats and their sources,
                            allowing for a more proactive response in future encounters. Without this history, Microsoft Defender might not recognize recurring threats
                            as quickly, possibly leaving your system more vulnerable. It's essential to understand that you're making a trade-off between enhanced
                            privacy and potentially reduced security.

                    This script diminishes unnecessary system data, thus enhancing your privacy and performance.

                    The **DISM tool** is used to manage Windows images and is often used to fix issues with the Windows operating system [1].

                    The **"Reset Base"** option can help to reduce the size of the WinSxS folder [2]. Once, "Reset Base" is enabled, you cannot
                    uninstall any previous updates [2]. This script activates the **"Reset Base"** feature, minimizing the size of WinSxS folder.
                    It contributes to the reduction of redundant data, enhancing both the performance of your system and your privacy.

                    The **WinSxS folder**, also known as the "Windows Side by Side" folder, is a component of the Windows operating system [3].
                    It is located in the Windows directory (for example, `C:\Windows\WinSxS`) [3]. The WinSxS folder is used to store system

                    This script deletes the Windows System Resource Usage Monitor (SRUM) database file.

                    SRUM tracks the usage of desktop applications, services, Windows applications, and network connections [1] [2] [3]. SRUM stores its file at
                    `C:\Windows\System32\sru\SRUDB.dat` [1] [3] [4].

                    Before deleting the file, the script temporarily stops the Diagnostic Policy Service (DPS). The DPS helps Windows detect and solve problems with its
                    components [4]. Stopping this service is required as modifications to the SRUM file require it to be turned off [5].

                    Deleting this file can enhance user privacy as it contains usage data and is often used for forensic analysis of user behavior [1] [6].

                    This script disables the Recall feature to address serious privacy concerns.

                    Recall is an AI feature introduced in Windows 11 on Copilot+ PCs [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].
                    It is designed to capture and store snapshots of your screen and analyze them [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7].
                    This feature allows users to browse and search their past activities, such as images and text [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7].

                    Recall includes a component called 'screenray'.
                    This component analyzes the snapshot's contents and lets you interact with elements within it [3] [5] [6].
                    This script will also disable the screenray feature [6].

                    This feature is enabled by default, so Windows will capture and store screen snapshots [2] [5] [6].
                    They remain on your computer for months by default [4].

                    Recall captures frequent screenshots, as frequent as multiple times during a minute [1] [2] [4].
                    These screenshots may include all visible content such as app data, websites, images, and documents [2] [5].
                    It may even include sensitive information like passwords and bank account numbers [2] [3].
                    The data is indexed, and the indexes are stored locally on your computer [5].

                    This feature raises significant security and privacy concerns.
                    Experts sometimes describe this feature as a 'privacy nightmare' [4] [7] or 'keylogger' [4] due to these concerns.
                    The privacy risks associated with this feature include:

                    - **Misuse**:
                      This data is stored locally on your computer [1] [2] [5] [7].
                      It poses a risk of unauthorized access to your sensitive and private data [4] [7].
                      Potential threats include malicious attackers, state actors, colleagues, or family members who could misuse this
                      information for identity theft, financial crime, phishing, or coercion.
                    - **Microsoft data collection**:
                      Microsoft's data collection policies may change.
                      As Mozilla expressed, this raises concerns about potential data sharing with law enforcement or the use of the data
                      for targeted advertising or AI training in the future [7].
                    - **Storing sensitive data**:
                      Microsoft does not perform content moderation on the snapshots [2] [3] [4] [7].
                      It means that sensitive information such as passwords or financial account numbers are visible and stored [2] [3],
                      posing a significant privacy and security risk.
                    - **Opt-in**:
                      The feature is opt-in by default [2] [6], and users can only opt-out of certain sites if they are using Microsoft Edge [3].
                      This limits user control over their privacy.
                    - **Lack of transparency:**
                      While Microsoft states that the snapshots are not sent to their servers [2] [7]
                      and that all analysis is conducted locally [1] [2] [3] [7].
                      However, Microsoft has not specified whether it collects the results of these analyses or any related diagnostic data.
                      United Kingdom's data protection agency finds this lack of transparency worrying [4] [7].
                    - **Language model vulnerabilities:**
                      Language models susceptibility to attacks like prompt engineering underlines its security risks [8].
                      More about security vulnerabilities: [Attacks on language models](https://erkinekici.com/articles/attacks-on-language-models/).

                    This script configures the `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsCopilot!DisableAIDataAnalysis` registry key [6].

                    By running this script, you enhance your privacy by preventing the storage and analysis of snapshots on your device [6],
                    thereby mitigating the associated risks.

                    This category enhances your privacy by restricting app access to sensitive personal data.
                    These scripts enable you to enforce the *principle of least privilege* ensuring that apps only have
                    access to the information absolutely necessary for their legitimate function, thereby minimizing potential
                    data misuse.

                    It specifically targets UWP (Universal Windows Platform) apps.
                    These apps can be both native system apps [1] and third-party apps [2].
                    They are typically available through the Microsoft Store [1] [2].
                    These scripts only affect UWP apps, not desktop applications outside the UWP ecosystem.

                    By disabling default app access to personal information and requiring explicit user permission,
                    these scripts protect your security and privacy.

                    This script disables the Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP).

                    CEIP collects user interaction data with Windows [1].
                    This includes hardware configurations (e.g., processor count, screen resolution), system performance, reliability metrics,
                    and user behaviors like folder creation on the desktop [1].
                    It also tracks usage of features such as the Event Viewer and Remote Assistance [1].

                    Collected data is used by Microsoft to identify software trends and user patterns [1].
                    This data is stored on Microsoft-controlled servers [1].
                    CEIP-related events are logged in the "Event Viewer" under `Windows Logs\Application` [1].
                    Storing this data on your computer can expose sensitive personal information to unauthorized third-parties.

                    By default, CEIP is disabled in Windows [1].
                    If enabled, it periodically collects and sends data to Microsoft [1].

                    Disabling CEIP enhances privacy by protecting data that reveals details about your system and personal behaviors.
                    This also speeds up your computer by reducing background activities such as network and hardware usage.
                    It is recommended by security frameworks like the CIS (Center for Internet Security) to protect your security [2].

                            Disabling CEIP through this script means all users on the computer are opted out [1] [2].
                            This enhances privacy by ensuring that data is neither stored locally nor shared with Microsoft.
                            Additionally, turning off CEIP improves system performance by reducing background data collection.
                            Security frameworks such as the CIS Center for Internet Security recommend this action to enhance your security [3].

                            This change is applied by modifying registry keys: 

                            - `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\SQMClient\Windows!CEIPEnable` [1] [2] [3]
                            - `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SQMClient\Windows!CEIPEnable` [1]

                            Without this script, CEIP may remain active [2].

                        docs: |-
                            This category includes scripts that disable scheduled tasks from the Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP).

                            The CEIP, designed by Microsoft, collects background data on user interactions with its products [1].
                            This data collection is executed through multiple background tasks that transmit usage data to Microsoft [1].

                            Scripts in this category stop these tasks, thereby reducing data transmission to Microsoft, enhancing privacy,
                            and improving system performance.

                            Use the following PowerShell command to list all scheduled tasks associated with the CEIP:

                            ```powershell
                            @('\Microsoft\Windows\Autochk\*', '\Microsoft\Windows\Customer Experience Improvement Program\*', '\Microsoft\Windows\DiskDiagnostic\*', '\Microsoft\Windows\Customer Experience Improvement Program\Server\*') `
                                | ForEach-Object { Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName '*' -TaskPath $_ -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue } `
                                | ForEach-Object { Write-Host "$($_.TaskPath)$($_.TaskName)" }
                            ```

                                    This script disables the "Proxy" scheduled task.

                                    This task sends Software Quality Metrics (SQM) data to Microsoft [1].
                                    SQM stands for "Software Quality Metrics" [2] [3], also known as "Software Quality Management" [4] [5].
                                    It is part of Microsoft's telemetry framework, gathering and sending usage and performance data to Microsoft [2] [3] [5].

                                    This task specifically collects and sends `autochk` SQM data [1].
                                    `autochk` is a Windows tool that checks file system integrity before Windows starts [6].

                                    This task enables features of the Customer Experience Improvement Program for participating users [7].
                                    It sends data when a user opts into the Microsoft Customer Experience Improvement Program [1].

                                    ### Why disable it?

                                    - **Privacy**:
                                      Disabling this task reduces data sent to Microsoft [1], enhancing your privacy.
                                    - **Performance and Reliability:**
                                      Microsoft suggests this task isn't required [7].
                                      Turning it off can boost performance [1] [8] and system reliability [1] [7].
                                    - **Security**:
                                      Enabling this background data collection task increases vulnerabilities.
                                      Authorities, such as the Polish government [9], advise disabling this task for enhanced security.

                                    The "Consolidator" task is a part of the Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) [1] [2] [3] [4].
                                    When enabled, this task collects and sends usage data to Microsoft [1] [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9].
                                    Introduced in Windows Vista [1], this task is present in later Windows versions [5].

                                    Disabling this task offers several benefits:

                                    - Enhances privacy.
                                      Microsoft states that disabling this task stops Windows data collection [5] [6].
                                      The governments of Poland [10] and Argentina [11] recommend disabling it for privacy
                                    - Improves system performance.
                                      Microsoft acknowledges that the task can degrade performance and impact other users and services [2] [5] [6].
                                      Microsoft also recommends disabling the task to optimize system performance [2] [5] [6].
                                    - Increases your security.
                                      In the past, malicious software has exploited this task [12].
                                      Disabling it reduces the attack surface by eliminating a potential exploitation vector.

                                    It is safe to disable this task according to Microsoft:

                                    - This task is not essential for core operating system functions [2] [5] [6].
                                    - It is not needed in all environments [2].
                                    - It should be disabled when deemed unnecessary [2] [3] [5] [6].

                                    ## Technical Details

                                    The task uses a program named `wsqmcons.exe` [1].
                                    The name `wsqmcons` stands for "Windows SQM Consolidator" [13] or "Windows Software Quality Management Consolidator" [14].
                                    This program runs daily if the user is part of CEIP [1].
                                    When it runs, it collects and transmits usage data to Microsoft [1] [9].
                                    The process resides in the `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32` folder  [1].

                                    CEIP data collection includes two tasks [7] [8]:

                                    1. `Consolidator`: Gathers and compresses CEIP data [7] [8].
                                    2. `Uploader`: Sends the data to Microsoft  [7] [8].

                                    This script disables the "Uploader" scheduled task.

                                    This task is part of the Windows Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) [1] [2].
                                    The Uploader task transfers CEIP data to Microsoft [1] [2] [3] [4].
                                    The data is sent every 19 [3] to 24 hours [1] [2].

                                    Disabling this task prevents automatic sharing of your usage data with Microsoft, enhancing your privacy.
                                    The Government of Vietnam recommends disabling this task to reduce data collection [5].
                                    Disabling the task may also improve system performance by reducing background processes.

                                    The task is located at `\Microsoft\Windows\Customer Experience Improvement Program\Uploader` [3] [4] [5].
                                    Disabling the task is safe and has no negative effects on other parts of the operating system [3].

                                    the Windows Server Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP).

                                    CEIP is a voluntary program that collects information about how people use Windows Server [1].

                                    It gathers data on:

                                    - Configuration settings [1]
                                    - Hardware configurations [1]
                                    - Usage patterns
                                    - Performance metrics

                                    Disabling these tasks prevents the system from automatically sending usage and performance data
                                    to Microsoft, enhancing user privacy.
                                    It may also improve system performance by reducing background activities.

                                    These tasks are typically present in server versions of the Windows operating system.
                                    These tasks may not be present in consumer editions of Windows.

                                    This category includes scripts designed to disable specific scheduled tasks related to the
                                    Windows Server Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP).

                                            This task is part of the "Windows Server Customer Experience Improvement Program" [1] [2] [3].
                                            The main function of this task is to collect and send usage and performance data to Microsoft.
                                            It runs without requiring user consent to participate in the CEIP [4].

                                            This task poses a significant privacy concern as it can share sensitive information without explicit user approval.
                                            Disabling this task prevents data transmission, aligning with best practices for privacy protection.
                                            It may also improve system performance.
                                            The Citrix optimization guide recommends disabling this task to enhance operating system performance [5].

                                            The task is located at `\Microsoft\Windows\Customer Experience Improvement Program\Server\ServerCeipAssistant` [1] [2] [3] [4] [6] [7].
                                            It runs `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\ceipdata.exe` [3] [6] [7].

                                            This task was originally introduced in Windows Server 2008 [2] [8].
                                            Tests show this task is absent in modern Windows versions.

                                            This script disables the "ServerRoleCollector" scheduled task.

                                            This task collects telemetry data about server roles [1].
                                            **Server roles** are specific functions a server performs for users and other computers within
                                            a network, such as providing web services or handling emails [2].
                                            This task is part of the "Windows Server Customer Experience Improvement Program" [3] [4].

                                            Disabling this task enhances privacy by preventing CEIP data collection.
                                            Additionally, it may improve system performance.
                                            The Citrix optimization guide recommends disabling this task to boost system performance [5].

                                            The task is located at `\Microsoft\Windows\Customer Experience Improvement Program\Server\ServerRoleCollector` [3] [4] [6] [7].
                                            It executes `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\ceiprole.exe` [3] [6] [7].
                                            This process is named "Windows Server Role Collector" [6] [8].

                                            This task was originally introduced in Windows Server 2008 [4] [9].
                                            The functionality of the Role Collector (`ceiprole.exe`) and its associated API
                                            were removed in Windows Server 2012 [1] [10] [11].
                                            Since then, Server Manager has taken over these responsibilities [1].

                    Application Experience comprises services and tasks that help applications, including older ones, run smoothly.
                    These components collect and send telemetry data to Microsoft, potentially impacting user privacy [1] [2] [3] [4].
                    
                    Scripts under this category aim to enhance user privacy, data protection, and protect the system from potential
                    vulnerabilities [5]. They also optimize system performance [1] [2] by removing non-essential operating system components.
                    
                    However, disabling Application Experience could influence the performance or compatibility of specific applications
                    or services on your system [3] [5].

                            This category covers disabling of the Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser.
                            This tool checks your computer's software and hardware compatibility with the latest Windows updates,
                            including major upgrades such as Windows 11 [1].
                            It scans your system, collecting detailed information about your apps and devices to ensure everything will work
                            smoothly with potential updates [2] [3].
                            This process helps Microsoft improve Windows and keep your system running efficiently with the latest features.
                            However, it sends substantial system usage data to Microsoft, raising privacy concerns for some users.

                            This script optimizes your computer by managing how it prepares for Windows updates.
                            The Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser, designed to check system readiness for new updates, routinely discards saved
                            update data [2].
                            Consequently, your computer must redownload this data during subsequent update checks, consuming significant
                            internet bandwidth [2] and CPU resources [3].
                            Preventing this redundancy, the script reduces internet usage and improves computer performance.

                            The Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser contributes to Desktop Analytics [2] (formerly Windows Analytics [4]), a system
                            that collects and sends Windows diagnostics and app usage data to Microsoft servers [4].
                            This service is unavailable in high-privacy settings such as GCC High or the US Department of Defense [4],
                            highlighting its potential privacy implications.
                            These organizations, known for stringent privacy and security standards, do not utilize Desktop Analytics, suggesting
                            the service's inherent data collection practices may not align with high-privacy protocols.

                            Despite its utility, Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser can introduce additional vulnerabilities to your system. A known
                            elevation of privilege vulnerability linked with the appraiser allows a configuration file to be susceptible to symbolic link
                            and hard link attacks, also known as the "Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability" [5].

                            By disabling the Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser, this category contributes to enhancing your system's privacy by reducing
                            unnecessary data transmission to Microsoft servers, mitigating potential vulnerabilities, and conserving network bandwidth
                            and CPU usage.

                                    The "Microsoft Compatibility Appraiser" is a default scheduled task in Windows [1] [2].
                                    It collects program telemetry information for participants in the Microsoft Customer Experience Improvement Program [2],
                                    and it maintains this data collection across computer reboots [2].

                                    Running at least daily [3], this task assesses your system's eligibility for Windows 11 upgrades [4].

                                    By disabling this task, the script helps in optimizing computer performance as recommended by Microsoft [1] [2].
                                    This action prevents the task from collecting and sending your computer's data to Microsoft, enhancing your privacy and conserving

                                    Running this script improves privacy and security by limiting data transmission, making it suitable for high-security environments.
                                    Recommendations to disable or delete this task have been voiced by both the Polish [2] and Argentine [3] governments.

                                    Microsoft acknowledges this task as non-essential, explaining that its deactivation improves system reliability and
                                    performance by preventing possible degradation [1] [4].
                                    It highlights that the task's deactivation will not adversely affect other users and services,
                                    reinforcing its non-critical nature [1].

                                    Running this script prioritizes privacy by reducing telemetry data sent to Microsoft.
                                    This choice comes without any notable drawbacks [1], thereby ensuring enhanced privacy and security.

                                    This script disables the "PcaPatchDbTask" scheduled task.

                                    "PcaPatchDbTask" is responsible for periodically updating a specific database that tracks software known to have compatibility issues [1].
                                    When users run a program listed in this database, Windows' Program Compatibility Assistant (PCA) will notify them and suggest a solution
                                    to address the compatibility problem the next time the program is started [2] [3]. By keeping this database updated, the PCA can consistently
                                    recognize and remedy compatibility conflicts, ensuring that even software designed for older Windows versions runs correctly on newer ones.

                                    This database is named the System Application Compatibility Database [3]. Its primary function is to support users in seamlessly operating older
                                    software on modern Windows versions by auto-applying compatibility settings when necessary.

                                    Besides compatibility features, 'PcaPatchDbTask' supports Windows' Dynamic Update process, performing tasks like [4]:

                                    - Retrieving the latest Windows updates and integrating them into the existing system [4]. This action can occasionally trigger antivirus alerts, labeling
                                    the process as "Riskware.Injector.Generic" [5].
                                    - Acquiring drivers that may be missing from the installation media [4].
                                    - Keeping the aforementioned compatibility database up-to-date [1] [4].

                                    "PcaPatchDbTask" was initially rolled out in Windows 10 [4] and it's present by default since Windows 10 21H1 and Windows 11 22H2.

                                    Disabling this task might enhance user privacy by preventing automated compatibility checks and updates. However, users might miss out on helpful
                                    compatibility solutions for older software.

                                    This script disables the "SdbinstMergeDbTask" scheduled task.

                                    The 'SdbinstMergeDbTask' task merges pending shim application compatibility databases, as described in
                                    Task Scheduler (Windows 11 22H2), facilitating the running of older software on newer Windows versions.

                                    According to Task Scheduler (Windows 11 22H2), the task utilizes the `sdbinst.exe` tool [1] [2] [3].
                                    This tool is known as the "Application Compatibility Database Installer" [4].
                                    It is part of the Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) [4] [5].
                                    It allows the deployment of SDB files (Windows Shim Database [6] [7]) to the computer [4] [5].
                                    Before any compatibility fixes or messages are applied [5], this tool is used to make sure applications run correctly, a process called application shimming [8].

                                    This task is associated with the collection of telemetry data [1] [2] [3].
                                    Telemetry data is information that software providers, such as Microsoft, gather about software usage.
                                    By disabling this task, the amount of telemetry data that Microsoft collects is reduced, which boosts user privacy.

                                    Additionally, there have been instances where malicious actors exploited this Windows feature to covertly gain
                                    unauthorized access and execute code within genuine Windows processes [2] [9] [10] [11].
                                    Disabling this task provides an added layer of security against such threats.

                                    Standard administrator rights are insufficient to turn off this task [12].
                                    Attempts to do so result in an `ERROR: Access is denied` message.
                                    To overcome this, the script escalates its privileges ensuring the task is correctly disabled.

                docs: |-
                    This category disables the Application Compatibility (AppCompat) framework on Windows.

                    The Application Compatibility (AppCompat) framework is a feature in Windows that collects data about application compatibility.
                    This includes gathering information about application crashes, issues, and other operational details to help improve the
                    compatibility of applications on Windows [1].

                    It is controlled by a set of policies within the Microsoft Windows operating system aimed at enabling applications designed
                    for older versions of Windows to function properly on newer versions [1].

                    However, the Application Compatibility framework involves various forms of data collection that may be considered invasive from
                    a privacy standpoint [1]. It can potentially be exploited to reveal more data about your application usage or to inject your
                    computer with malware [2] [3] [4].

                    By disabling the AppCompat framework, this script contributes to enhancing users' privacy by limiting potential data collection
                    and exposure to malware exploitation.

                            This script disables Application Impact Telemetry (AIT).

                            Application Impact Telemetry (AIT) is a function that tracks the usage of certain Windows system components by
                            various applications [1]. Turning this feature off stops the collection of usage data [1], enhancing your privacy
                            by ensuring that your usage patterns and behaviors are not sent to external servers.

                            Disabling telemetry will take effect on any newly launched applications [1]. To ensure that telemetry collection has
                            stopped for all applications, please reboot your machine [1].

                            Note that if the Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) is turned off, Application Telemetry will be disabled
                            regardless of this setting [1].

                            This script performs its function by modifying a specific registry key:
                            `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\AppCompat!AITEnable`. This is the switch that controls the AIT setting
                            within the operating system [1].

                            This script disables the Application Compatibility Engine on Windows systems.

                            The Application Compatibility Engine examines a compatibility database every time an application starts [1]. If it finds a match
                            for the application, it either applies compatibility fixes or displays a help message for known problems with the application [1].
                            This process may inadvertently reveal data about the applications you run on your system, especially if the query functions are
                            intercepted [2]. Moreover, this database can be utilized by malware creators to modify an application and make it perform unintended
                            actions [3].

                            Disabling the Application Compatibility Engine leads to enhanced system performance [1]. However, this might compromise the compatibility
                            of many older, popular applications and permit the installation of known incompatible applications [1]. Additionally, certain Windows
                            features like Windows Resource Protection and User Account Control use this engine to resolve application issues [1]. Without the engine,
                            these solutions won't be applied, and applications may not install or run correctly [1].

                            This option is suitable for users seeking faster performance who are knowledgeable about the compatibility of the applications they use [1].
                            Keep in mind that any changes to this setting require a system reboot to take effect as many system processes cache this setting's value for
                            performance reasons [1].

                            The script achieves its goal by altering a specific registry key: `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\AppCompat!DisableEngine` [1].
                            By disabling this engine, known to be a vulnerability exploited by malware [4], the script reduces the potential attack surface on the system,
                            enhancing overall security.

                            This script removes the "Program Compatibility" tab from the file properties context menu. This tab is visible on the property context menu
                            of any program shortcut or executable file, and displays options that can be applied to the application to solve common issues affecting
                            older applications [1].

                            When enabled, this script prevents the compatibility property page from appearing in the context menus, though it does not impact any prior
                            compatibility settings applied to applications through this interface [1].

                            This script achieves its functionality by modifying a specific registry key:
                            `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\AppCompat!DisablePropPage` [1].

                            This setting is often used in organizational environments to prevent end-users from modifying the compatibility settings of applications.
                            It ensures that applications operate with the settings considered most suitable by the system administrator or IT department. This restriction
                            aids in upholding system stability and security by ensuring users cannot run applications in modes recognized to be insecure or unstable.

                            This script assists in upholding a more secure and stable environment by barring unauthorized changes to application compatibility settings.
                            The security benefits include:

                            - **Restricting User Actions**: By limiting the actions that a user can perform, administrators can prevent unintended security vulnerabilities.
                            Users may inadvertently (or intentionally) choose settings that could expose the system to risks, and this script helps in preventing
                            such scenarios.
                            - **Maintaining Known Configurations**: By ensuring that applications can only run in certain compatibility modes, administrators can more
                            effectively manage and secure their environments. They can thoroughly test and verify the security of the allowed configurations, leading to
                            a more robust security posture.
                            - **Preventing Exploitation of Vulnerabilities**: Some compatibility settings might make applications run in a less secure mode to maintain
                            compatibility with older software or systems. Preventing users from enabling such settings can help in avoiding potential vulnerabilities
                            associated with these modes.

                            By preventing users from changing compatibility settings, you could prevent them from selecting settings that send additional data to
                            software vendors (for example, certain compatibility modes might enable additional telemetry or error reporting). Though primarily aimed at
                            control and stability, this restriction indirectly contributes to privacy protection by reducing potential unwanted data transmission.

                            This script disables Steps Recorder on your device.

                            Steps Recorder, formerly known as Problem Steps Recorder [1] [2], is a tool that records the actions taken on a computer, including keyboard and mouse inputs,
                            user interface interactions, and screenshots with every click [2] [3].This tool is used to diagnose and troubleshoot problems by capturing the exact steps
                            taken when an issue occurs [1]. The data collected by Steps Recorder can be sent to Microsoft or third-party developers [3] [4], potentially revealing sensitive
                            user information.

                            By running this script, the Steps Recorder functionality will be turned off by altering a specific registry key:
                            `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\AppCompat!DisableUAR` [3]. This prevents the automatic recording and sharing of user action data, enhancing the
                            privacy and security of the user's device.

                            Not running this script leaves the Steps Recorder enabled by default on Windows [3], allowing it to record and potentially share user actions and information.

                            Using this script enhances user privacy by ensuring that personal actions taken on a computer are not automatically recorded and shared without the
                            user's knowledge or consent. It's a straightforward measure to increase your control over your own device and data. Additionally, disabling Steps Recorder
                            is recommended by The Australian Signals Directorate's Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) [5].

                            While enhancing privacy, this script may complicate the troubleshooting process as Steps Recorder will not be available to easily record and share encountered
                            issues.

                            This script disables the "Inventory Collector" task on your computer.

                            The Inventory Collector is a feature in Windows that gathers data about the applications, files, devices, and drivers on your system and sends
                            this information to Microsoft [1]. This process is used to help solve compatibility problems, ensuring that your software and hardware work
                            together without issues [1].

                            Running this script will turn off the Inventory Collector, ensuring no data is sent to Microsoft [1]. It also stops the collection of installation
                            data through the Program Compatibility Assistant [1]. By disabling these features, you prevent potentially sensitive information from being shared
                            and avoid uncontrolled updates to your system [2] [3]. If not disabled, the Inventory Collector remains active, continuing to send data [1].

                            If the Customer Experience Improvement Program is turned off, the Inventory Collector will already be inactive, and running this script will have no
                            effect [1].

                            Disabling Inventory Collector is advised by several organizations and authorities for enhanced security:

                            - The Australian Signals Directorate's Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) [4]
                            - The Department of Defense (DoD) information systems in the USA [2]
                            - Microsoft, as part of Windows security baseline for Azure [3]
                            - National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the USA [5]

                            This advice is based on the principle of limiting the amount of data shared, contributing to better privacy and security.

                            When you run this script, it modifies a specific registry key (`HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\AppCompat!DisableInventory`) to turn off the
                            Inventory Collector [1].

                            > **Caution:** Disabling the Inventory Collector may lead to challenges in identifying and resolving compatibility issues
                            > between your software and hardware.

                        category: Disable Program Compatibility Assistant (PCA)
                        docs: |-
                            This category covers disabling the Program Compatibility Assistant (PCA) in Windows.

                            The PCA is designed to help users run desktop applications created for earlier versions of Windows by tracking and identifying known compatibility
                            issues [1]. When an issue is detected, PCA offers the user a recommended fix to help the app run better on Windows [1].

                            **Privacy Implications:**

                            1. **Tracking and Monitoring of Application Activities:** PCA tracks the activities and behaviors of applications to identify symptoms of compatibility
                            issues [1]. Continuous monitoring could inadvertently collect user data, depending on the nature of the applications being monitored and the specifics
                            of the compatibility issues. This persistent oversight could be seen as an invasion of privacy as users' application usage is consistently observed.
                            2. **Application and System Data Access:** PCA accesses data about the application and system to determine appropriate compatibility modes and fixes [1].
                            Access to application and system data might inadvertently lead to access to sensitive or personal information. The extent of PCA's access to such information
                            is not clear from the official documentations, presenting a potential privacy concern.
                            3. **Automatic Modifications and Permissions:** PCA automatically applies certain compatibility modes to resolve issues, such as giving applications
                            administrative privileges or preventing an app from freeing a DLL from memory [1]. Automatic changes in application permissions or behavior could potentially
                            introduce security risks, as apps might gain access to resources or data they would not normally have access to. Users may not be fully aware of the extent of
                            the changes applied, leading to unintentional security or privacy vulnerabilities.
                            4. **User Notification and Consent:** While PCA does notify users and often requires their input to apply recommended settings, some fixes are applied silently [1].
                            Users might not be aware of all the changes PCA makes to application settings and system configurations, limiting their control over their own system and potential
                            impacts on their privacy.
                            5. **User Feedback and Data Sharing with Microsoft**: At the end of each scenario, after the app is run with recommended compatibility settings, the Program Compatibility
                            Assistant (PCA) will ask the user a simple question to gather feedback on whether the app worked or failed with the compatibility setting [1]. This data is sent to
                            Microsoft [1]. Users may have concerns about sending any kind of data to Microsoft. Some users might be wary of potential data mishandling or misuse. It's crucial
                            to ensure that the data collected is securely stored and processed, and that users are adequately informed about what data is being collected and how it will be used.
                            6. **Detection and Mitigation Measures by PCA**: The PCA automatically detects issues with applications and applies various mitigation measures [1]. The automatic
                            detection and mitigation by PCA imply that the system is continuously monitoring application behavior, which might be seen as invasive by some users. There could be
                            concerns regarding what kind of data is accessed by PCA during this monitoring and whether any sensitive data could potentially be exposed.
                            7. **Downloading Missing Components for Apps:** PCA provides a recommendation to download missing components and install them after the app terminates [1].
                            This could involve downloading software from the internet, which may introduce security and privacy risks [1]. Users might inadvertently download malicious software or
                            software with privacy-invasive features if not adequately guided [1].
                            8. **Handling of Administrative Privileges:** PCA handles various scenarios involving administrative privileges and User Account Control (UAC) dialogs, including applying
                            the `RUNASADMIN` compatibility mode to certain installers and applets [1]. This handling of administrative privileges could potentially be exploited by malicious software
                            to gain elevated privileges without adequate user knowledge or consent. It is important to ensure that the mechanisms for handling administrative privileges are secure and
                            not prone to exploitation.
                            9. **Using the Compatibility Troubleshooter**: The Compatibility Troubleshooter allows users to apply recommended fixes to get apps working properly [1]. Use of the
                            Compatibility Troubleshooter involves sharing more data regarding app behavior and issues with Microsoft, raising similar concerns as mentioned above regarding data sharing.

                            By disabling PCA, these potential privacy and security concerns can be mitigated, giving users more control over their data and application behavior, and reducing the risk
                            of unintentional data collection and sharing.

                                    This script disables the Program Compatibility Assistant (PCA) feature in Windows [1].

                                    The purposes include:

                                    - Enhances privacy by stopping the continuous monitoring and data collection by PCA. The PCA monitors applications run by the user [1].
                                    - Users gain more control over their system by manually managing application compatibility issues. When a potential compatibility issue with an
                                    application is detected, the PCA will prompt the user with recommended solutions [1].
                                    - Potentially avoids the automatic changes made by PCA that might introduce security risks.
                                    - It increases the system performance. Microsoft recommends turning off the PCA can be useful for those who require better performance and are
                                    already aware of application compatibility issues [1].

                                    This script modifies a specific registry key (`HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\AppCompat!DisablePCA`) to turn off the PCA [1].
                                    As a result, users will not receive automatic solutions to known compatibility issues when running applications [1], ensuring that they have
                                    control over the solutions they apply.

                                    By default, if you do not run this script or disable PCA manually, the PCA will be turned on [1].

                                    Once this script is executed and PCA is turned off, the user won't be presented with solutions to known compatibility issues when running applications [1].

                                    This script disables the "Program Compatibility Assistant Service" (`PcaSvc`) in Windows [1].

                                    The `PcaSvc` assists the Program Compatibility Assistant (PCA) in monitoring programs installed and run by the user [1], detecting known compatibility problems [1],
                                    and aiding in Windows appraiser data collection [2]. By disabling this service, the script prevents PCA from functioning [1], thereby halting application monitoring
                                    and data collection, leading to enhanced user privacy.

                                    This script turns off the `PcaSvc` which is, by default, automatically started in Windows [1].

                                    Microsoft has clarified that disabling this service does not have a negative impact on the system's functionality, affirming that it's safe to execute this action [1].

                                    By running this script, you prevent the continuous surveillance and data gathering activities conducted by PCA.

                            Windows Census is a component that collects device configuration data [1].
                            This configuration data includes your operating system, region, language, and hardware architecture [2].
                            Microsoft uses this data to determine which updates are appropriate for your system [3].

                            Disabling Census enhances privacy by preventing the collection and transmission of device data to Microsoft [1] [2] [3].
                            However, this may affect Windows' ability to provide tailored updates.

                            These capabilities are meant to provide insights for IT administrators but collect and transmit data from end user devices.

                            These scripts can help limit enterprise/Microsoft visibility into your device, but may limit management capabilities on

                                    Desktop Analytics is a cloud-based service that provides insights about Windows devices in an organization.
                                    The service provides insight and intelligence from user data [1].

                                    Desktop Analytics collects diagnostic data from enrolled Windows devices and sends it to Microsoft cloud services [1].
                                    It creates an inventory of apps running in an organization. This data provides insights about application compatibility
                                    and pilot identification to help IT administrators in organizations evaluate the readiness and compatibility of devices
                                    for Windows feature updates [1].

                                    To enable data collection, Desktop Analytics configures settings on the device registry and group policies related
                                    to commercial ID, telemetry levels, and data sharing [2].

                                    While this data sharing raises potential privacy concerns, Microsoft states that privacy controls allow organizations
                                    to limit data collection [1].

                                    Desktop Analytics is retired since November 30, 2022 in favor of Microsoft Intune and Configuration Manager [3].

                                            This script ensures that Microsoft does not process Windows diagnostic data from your device [1].

                                            When activated, it modifies a setting known as the Group Policy object on your device. This object is a set of policies that determine how your system operates.
                                            The script disables a policy related to Microsoft's Desktop Analytics service. This service is designed to provide insights into the health and usage of your
                                            devices but may involve processing diagnostic data [2].

                                            By disabling this policy, the script helps to enhance the privacy of your device by preventing the processing of its diagnostic data by Microsoft. This means
                                            that information about the usage and performance of your device will not be sent to Microsoft's Desktop Analytics service [1][2].

                                            This script enhances privacy by ensuring that the name of your device is anonymized in any diagnostic data collected by Microsoft Desktop Analytics [1].
                                            In other words, instead of your actual device name, "Unknown" will appear in the data [1].

                                            Since the release of Windows 10, version 1803, the device name is not included in the diagnostic data by default [1].
                                            This script guarantees that this privacy-enhancing measure remains in place [1].

                                            When implemented, it changes a specific registry setting, `AllowDeviceNameInTelemetry`, which controls whether the device name is included
                                            in Windows diagnostic data [2]. The script sets this value to `0`, thus disabling the inclusion of the device name in the data [2].

                                            This script configures Microsoft Edge to prevent it from sending your browsing history data to Desktop Analytics [1].
                                            This browsing data can include information from either your intranet or internet history, or both [1].

                                            When you use Microsoft Edge for browsing, it can collect and send your browsing history to Desktop Analytics, a Microsoft
                                            service that helps enterprises to analyze and improve their IT environment. If this setting is disabled, Microsoft Edge
                                            does not send any browsing history data, thereby enhancing your privacy.

                                            The script achieves this by modifying a specific value in the Windows Registry. The specific value that the script modifies
                                            is `MicrosoftEdgeDataOptIn` located at `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection`. The script sets this value
                                            to `0`, which indicates to Microsoft Edge that it should not send browsing history data to Desktop Analytics [1].

                                            While enhancing privacy, this could limit the functionality of Desktop Analytics for enterprises that rely on this service
                                            for IT insights. However, for individual users, this script can help prevent unwanted data collection and transmission,
                                            contributing to an overall safer browsing experience [1].

                                            This script controls whether diagnostic data from your device is processed by Windows Update for Business cloud [1] [2].

                                            If enabled, the script can enhance privacy by ensuring that diagnostic data from your device is not processed by the
                                            Windows Update for Business cloud (WufB) [1], an update management service provided by Microsoft [3]. This service
                                            typically helps businesses manage updates on their devices efficiently. But if privacy is a concern, you can opt
                                            to disable it [3].

                                            The policy is applicable to devices joined to Azure Active Directory [1]. Azure Active Directory is a Microsoft cloud
                                            service that provides identity and access capabilities.

                                            Disabling this policy means that some features of the Windows Update for Business deployment service might not be
                                            available. However, your device will gain an added layer of privacy as diagnostic data will not be processed by the
                                            business cloud [1].

                                            Update Compliance is a service provided by Microsoft hosted in Azure, which uses Windows diagnostic data [1].
                                            This service doesn't meet the US Government community compliance (GCC) requirements [1], and is utilized by
                                            both Desktop Analytics and Azure Update Management [1].

                                            This script is designed to disable the Update Compliance processing of diagnostic data on your device. When
                                            this script is run, it modifies the system registry to prevent diagnostic data from your device being processed
                                            by Update Compliance. This change in settings increases the privacy of your device by limiting the diagnostic data
                                            that can be accessed and analyzed by Microsoft's services.

                                            Diagnostic data, in this context, includes information about device health, system events, and usage metrics. By
                                            disabling the processing of this data, the script helps protect the privacy of your activities on your device [1].

                                            This script can be reversed at any time by using the provided `revertCode` if you decide to re-enable the processing
                                            of diagnostic data by Update Compliance.

                                            In technical terms, the script sets the `AllowUpdateComplianceProcessing` value in the
                                            `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection` registry path to 0, which disables the processing of

                            This script improves your privacy by blocking the transmission of diagnostic and usage telemetry data
                            from your Windows device [1]. This includes data about your device's usage, app compatibility, and
                            system performance, which can be sensitive in nature. By stopping this data from being sent, you reduce
                            the amount of personal information that could potentially be accessed by third parties.

                            The script works by configuring the Group Policy Object (GPO) and Local Policy preferences, which
                            essentially govern your device's data sharing policies [2]. These modifications restrict the data that Windows
                            and its built-in apps can collect and send.

                            Upon executing this script, Desktop Analytics will be disabled, as it relies on basic diagnostic data to
                            function [2]. Desktop Analytics is a cloud-based service provided by Microsoft [4]. It provides insights
                            and intelligence for IT administrators [4]. Desktop Analytics is deprecated and was retired on November 30, 2022.

                            Once this script is executed, even if the policy permits a telemetry setting of Security or Basic, users
                            will not have the capability to opt for a higher data sharing level [3]. This restriction is limited to the
                            operating system and apps included with Windows, and does not pertain to third-party apps installed on your
                            device [3].

                            This script turns off the OneSettings service, a feature from Microsoft that downloads configuration settings [1].
                            This action can enhance the privacy and security of your Windows desktop environment by managing a feature called
                            the Services Configuration [1].

                            Services Configuration is a mechanism that various Windows components and apps use to update their settings dynamically [2] [3].
                            By default, Windows periodically tries to connect with the OneSettings service to download configuration settings [1].
                            This script turns off that function, reducing the chance of data being shared with third-party vendors [1].

                            This script is recommended by CIS Microsoft Windows Desktop Benchmarks [1]. Please be aware that turning off this service might
                            affect how certain apps that rely on this service work [3].

                            The script changes a registry setting to disable OneSettings downloads [3] [1]. It also provides a revert code to undo this change,
                            if needed, which returns the system to its previous state.

                            If you want to limit how much data is sent to Microsoft, turning off the OneSettings service can help enhance your privacy [1].
                            For more information about the impact of OneSettings on privacy, visit
                            [learn.microsoft.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20230803025857/https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/privacy/basic-level-windows-diagnostic-events-and-fields-1809).

                            This script lets you manage your privacy by restricting the automatic configuration updates of Windows components and apps,
                            including telemetry services, from the cloud [3] [1].

                            By using this script, Windows will not connect to OneSettings to fetch any configuration settings [1].
                            This reduces the amount of data sent to third-party vendors, which can help alleviate potential security concerns [1].

                            However, please be aware that while this setting can enhance privacy, turning off this service could lead to some applications
                            not working properly. These applications may depend on dynamic configuration updates that will be stopped when the service is
                            disabled [3] [1].

                            This script disables the Windows Error Reporting (WER) feature.

                            Windows Error Reporting collects and sends error logs from your computer to Microsoft [1], which can be a potential privacy concern for users.
                            By disabling it, this script ensures that your system errors remain local to your machine and are not sent to external servers.

                            Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

                            1. **Registry Changes**: The script modifies specific registry entries to disable the WER functionality and its related settings.

                            2. **Scheduled Tasks**: The script disables scheduled tasks related to error details updates and queue reporting.

                            3. **Services**: The script disables the services related to error reporting.

                category: Disable connectivity checks
                docs: |- # refactor-with-variables: Same • NCSI caution
                    This category contains scripts that disable various connectivity checks performed by Windows.

                    Connectivity checks allow Windows to assess network status and quality.
                    These checks involve communication with Microsoft servers, which may raise privacy concerns.
                    Disabling these checks reduces data sent to Microsoft, potentially enhancing your privacy.

                    Connectivity checks are considered **noise** because they constantly generate small amounts of network traffic.
                    **Noise** in networking refers to excessive data that doesn't help data transmission.
                    This has both security and performance implications.

                    Connectivity checks can contribute to **fingerprinting**, as they regularly communicate with specific servers.
                    **Fingerprinting** in network terms is a way to identify or track a device based on its unique characteristics or behavior.
                    These regular checks can potentially be used to identify or track your device on a network.

                    Connectivity checks can be seen as a form of **homecalling** because they involve your device regularly communicating with Microsoft servers.
                    **Homecalling** is when software automatically sends data back to its creator or a third party, often without the user's explicit knowledge or consent.
                    While the primary purpose of these checks is to ensure network functionality, they also provide Microsoft with information about your
                    device's online status and potentially your location [1].
                    Disabling these checks stops the automatic 'calls home,' enhancing privacy but potentially affecting system functions.

                    Disabling these checks may enhance privacy by:

                    - Reducing data transmission to Microsoft servers
                    - Limiting the collection of your IP address and location information [1]
                    - Decreasing the attack surface for potential vulnerabilities

                    However, disabling these checks may also lead to several side effects, including:

                    - Inaccurate reporting of network status (e.g., showing "no internet" when connected) [2] [3]
                    - Issues with captive portal detection (hotspot) common in public Wi-Fi networks [4] [5] [6]
                    - Functionality problems in some Microsoft and third-party applications [1] [2] [7] [8]
                    - Reduced ability to automatically adapt to different network environments

                    Consider your privacy needs and the potential impact on system functionality before applying these scripts.
                    Some users may find the privacy benefits outweigh the inconveniences, while others might prefer to keep
                    these checks enabled for smoother network interactions.

                    > **Caution**: This may lead to:
                    >   - Lack of immediate feedback on network status.
                    >   - Potential functionality issues in the system and applications that rely on NCSI for network information.

                        docs: |- # refactor-with-variables: Same • NCSI caution
                            This script prevents Network Connectivity Status Indicator (NCSI) from performing active connectivity checks.

                            ### Active Probing Overview

                            NCSI checks internet connectivity by requesting and downloading specific web pages [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6].
                            This process is also known as *active probing* [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] or *active tests* [1] [2] [4] [7] [11] [12].

                            Active probing checks internet connection by accessing certain URLs:

                            - `http://www.msftconnecttest.com/connecttest.txt` [5] [6] [7] [10] [12] [13] [14].
                            - `http://www.msftconnecttest.com/redirect` [7].
                            - `http://www.msftncsi.com/ncsi.txt` (on earlier versions) [4] [7] [12] [13] [15].
                            - `dns.msftncsi.com` [3] [4] [6] [7] [15].

                            Windows conducts these tests by default [1] [2] [3].
                            They ensure accurate reporting of internet connectivity across the system [1] [2] [3].

                            Active probes are triggered in the following situations:

                            - General interface or network condition changes [6].
                              E.g., when a wireless connection is established [6].
                            - Proxy detection or changes [6].
                            - Hotspot detection or changes [6].

                            ### Impacts of Disabling Active Probing

                            Microsoft recommends keeping these tests enabled due to their crucial role in detecting network status [4] [7].
                            Disabling active connectivity tests may lead to:

                            - Windows indicating no internet access despite an active connection [4] [9] [16].
                            - The no internet symbol appearing even though there is internet connectivity [8] [11] [13] [17].
                            - Applications and system services that rely on NCSI's status reports may malfunction [1] [2].
                              For instance, Microsoft Outlook might fail to connect to its server, or Windows updates could fail despite an active internet connection [7].
                            - Disabling NCSI tests disrupts the automatic detection of captive portals [4] [5] [6] [17].
                              This feature is common in public Wi-Fi networks, and its absence may inconvenience frequent users of these networks.
                              Without this feature, connecting to these networks may require manual intervention as no popup will appear automatically.

                            Disabling these tests improves your privacy, by preventing:

                            - The operating system from automatically checking connectivity by communicating with Microsoft servers [7] [14].
                            - Microsoft from collecting your IP addresses and location information through these tests [15].

                            Disabling these tests can also enhance security:

                            - These tests carry a security risk by allowing attackers to hijack DNS and gain access to your computer [14], potentially spreading malware [10].
                            - Active probes can interfere with security and privacy software such as VPN [4] [6] and firewalls [4], potentially disrupting their functionality.

                            > **Caution**: This may lead to:
                            > - Lack of immediate feedback on network status.
                            > - Potential functionality issues in the system and applications that rely on NCSI for network information.

                            ### Technical Details

                            This script modifies the following registry settings:

                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\NetworkConnectivityStatusIndicator!NoActiveProbe` [1] [2] [7] [9] [12].
                              This setting affects components like `ncsi.dll` [18].
                              It requires a computer restart to take effect [12].
                            - `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NlaSvc\Parameters\Internet!EnableActiveProbing` [3] [4] [7] [9] [11] [13].
                              This setting affects components like `ncsi.dll` [18] and `WebRuntimeManager.dll` [19].

                            Some sources may suggest modifying `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\NetworkConnectivityStatusIndicator!EnableActiveProbing` registry key.
                            However, this key is undocumented and this script does not modify this undocumented setting.

                            This script stops passive connectivity checks on your Windows device.

                            Passive connectivity tests are also known as *Network Connectivity Status Indicator (NCSI)* [1]
                            or *passive polling* [1] [2] [3] [4].
                            It tracks the network activity of applications on your computer [1] [3].
                            This feature is turned on by default [1].
                            These tests run every 15 seconds by default [5] [6].
                            They use information from received data, such as recently sent or received packets and
                            their Time To Live (TTL) values, to determine network status [7].

                            When NCSI fails to check internet connectivity, it opens the MSN Portal in your default browser [1].
                            This involves making an HTTP connection to `http://www.msftconnecttest.com/redirect` and then to the MSN Portal [1].
                            This method may expose your activities to Microsoft, bypass local network rules, and leak network configuration details,
                            posing privacy and security risks.
                            It may also inadvertently load external content or scripts from the MSN Portal, introducing vulnerabilities or tracking mechanisms.
                            Malicious actors may exploit this behavior to detect active internet connections or trigger specific network activities,
                            compromising your privacy and security.

                            Disabling passive polling enhances privacy by reducing continuous network monitoring.
                            It may also improve system performance by decreasing background network activity.
                            Disabling passive connectivity tests prevents Windows from automatically connecting to Microsoft servers
                            and opening external web pages [1].
                            This reduces the risk of data leakage, tracking, and potential exploitation of this automated network activity.
                            It can also improve security because passive probes sometimes conflict with VPN software [7] [8] and firewalls [7] [9].
                            Disabling them may improve system functionality when using such security or privacy software [8] [9].

                            However, this change has significant drawbacks.
                            It may cause the system to incorrectly report no internet connection, even when one exists [2] [10] [11].
                            This can affect functionality of system components and applications that rely on NCSI for network information [1].
                            For example, it can interfere with Windows' ability to download updates [1].
                            Microsoft does not recommend disabling the NCSI probes [1] [7].

                            > **Caution**: This may lead to:
                            >   - Lack of immediate feedback on network status.
                            >   - Potential functionality issues in the system and applications that rely on NCSI for network information.
                            >   - Reduced ability of Windows and other components to determine internet connectivity.
                            >   - False reporting of no internet connection even though there is internet connectivity.

                            This script removes the "NcsiUwpApp" system app.
                            It is also known as the "Network Connectivity Status Indicator Universal Windows Platform App".

                            It is primarily responsible for indicating network connectivity status.
                            The NCSI feature provides the functionality that allows Windows to offer visual feedback on network
                            connection status, usually seen at the bottom-right of the taskbar [1].
                            It is used not only by the Windows operating system but also by third-party applications for determining
                            network configurations [1].

                            NCSI employs both active and passive probes to assess network connectivity [1]
                            Active probes involve HTTP requests to Microsoft-managed servers [1], hosted by Akamai [1], with connectivity tests
                            directed to `www.msftconnecttest.com` [2].
                            Passive probes assess connectivity by examining network traffic [1].

                            The app's configuration, located in `%SYSTEMROOT%\SystemApps\NcsiUwpApp_8wekyb3d8bbwe\AppxManifest.xml`, indicates
                            that it operates without a visible user interface and is not listed in the start menu or app list.
                            Its primary function is to manage the maintenance of the NCSI component and communicate over the internet.
                            This absence of a user interface can be confirmed by running `explorer.exe shell:appsFolder\NcsiUwpApp_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App`.

                            Removing this app improves privacy by reducing data transmission to external servers for connectivity checks.
                            It also increases security by diminishing the operating system's vulnerability surface through the removal of
                            unnecessary software and provides greater control over the visibility of device network status.

                            This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [3].

                            > **Caution**: This may lead to:
                            >   - Lack of immediate feedback on network status.

                            This script prevents Windows from connecting to Microsoft connectivity check URLs.

                            This script enhances your privacy by blocking specific hosts that Microsoft uses to collect your IP address [1].

                            The blocked hosts are:

                            - `msftncsi.com` [2] [3] [4]
                            - `www.msftncsi.com` [2] [5] [6] [7] [8]
                            - `dns.msftncsi.com` [2] [3] [5] [7] [8] [9] [10]
                            - `ipv6.msftncsi.com` [2] [8]
                            - `msftconnecttest.com` [2] [3] [4] [9] [11]
                            - `www.msftconnecttest.com` [2] [3] [7] [9] [10] [12]
                            - `ipv6.msftconnecttest.com` [8] [10] [11]

                            However, this script may cause several side effects:

                            - It disrupts captive portal (hotspot) detection [5] [6] [13].
                            - It impairs functionality of Microsoft software like Azure Backup MARS agent [14] and on-premises data gateway [15].
                            - A 'no internet' symbol may appear even when you are connected to the internet [2].

                            Carefully weigh the privacy benefits against potential functionality issues before applying this script.

                            > **Caution**: This may lead to:
                            > - Lack of immediate feedback on network status.
                            > - Potential functionality issues in the system and applications that rely on NCSI for network information.
                            > - Reduced ability of Windows and other components to determine internet connectivity.
                            > - Windows and other software may incorrectly report that you're offline.
                            > - Issues with automatically opening the sign-in page when a captive portal (hotspot) is detected.

                            Disable "Network Location Awareness (NLA)" service
                            (breaks auto-reconnect, connectivity status, network identification)
                        docs: |- # refactor-with-variables: Same • NCSI caution
                            This script disables the Network Location Awareness (NLA) service.

                            NLA collects and stores network configuration information and notifies programs of changes [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6].
                            This data collection can pose privacy concerns.
                            It determines network connectivity type and properties, helping Windows manage connections [7] [8].
                            NLA uses the Network Connectivity Status Indicator (NCSI) to assess internet connectivity [7] [9].
                            NCSI is responsible for detecting Internet connectivity status [9].

                            Key functions of NLA:

                            - Generates unique identifiers (GUIDs) for each network interface [6] [10]
                            - Interacts with Windows Firewall to apply appropriate rules based on network profiles [10]
                            - Provides connectivity status for various applications such as Microsoft Teams and Windows Update [8]

                            Benefits of disabling NLA:

                            - Enhances privacy by stopping communication with Microsoft servers for connectivity detection (NCSI) [7] [8] [9] [11]
                            - Increases security by reducing potential vulnerabilities [12] [13]
                            - Reduces background processes, potentially optimizing system performance [4] [15]

                            Microsoft considers this service 'OK to disable' to reduce data collection and optimize system performance [4].
                            Disabling NLA does not impact the essential operations of the operating system [14].
                            Citrix recommends disabling it on VDI/RDS machines [15].

                            Side effects of disabling NLA:

                            - Lack of network configuration information [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [11]
                            - Failure of related services on Windows 10 such as `Dhcp`, `nsi`, `RpcSs`, `Tcpip`
                            `EventLog` and `netprofm` [2] [3]
                            - Issues with network identification (such as "Home", "Work", "Public") and firewall profile determination [10]
                            - Broken internet connectivity status detection and network status alerts [7] [9]
                            - Problems with captive portal (hotspot) detection [11]
                            - Difficulties with the auto-reconnect functionality of different apps [6] [14] [16]

                            > **Caution**: This may lead to:
                            > - Lack of immediate feedback on network status.
                            > - Potential functionality issues in the system and applications that rely on NCSI for network information.

                            ### Overview of default service statuses

                            This service runs and starts by default on Windows 10 [2] [3] but not on Windows 11 [1].
                            NLA service is available on both Windows 10 [2] [3] and Windows 11 [1],
                            but its NCSI functionality applies to Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019 and earlier versions [11].
                            Its functionality has been replaced by Network List Service (NLS) on Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 and later [8] [11].
                            This script does not disable this service on Windows 11 as it no longer manages NCSI and offers no clear privacy benefit.
                            This script targets Windows 10, where disabling NLA enhances privacy by preventing NCSI functionality.

                        docs: |-
                            This script disables "Network List Service (NLS)" service.
                            This service is technically identified as `netprofm` [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6].

                            NLS collects and stores properties for connected networks and notifies applications of changes [1] [2] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8].
                            It manages network-related information similarly to how a computer caches domain name IP addresses [7].

                            Benefits of disabling NLS:

                            - Enhancing your privacy.
                              Disabling this service halts communication with Microsoft servers for connectivity detection [1] [3].
                            - Improving your security by reducing the attack surface.
                              Any service or application is a potential point of attack [1].
                              It's a security best-practices to disable or remove any unneeded services [1].
                              NLS has had vulnerabilities in the past [9].
                            - Optimizing system performance.
                              This service is associated with high CPU usage [10].

                            However, disabling NLS may cause several issues:

                            - Windows Firewall may default to the Public profile [11].
                            - The **Network Sharing Center** may not display profile types or connection status [11].
                            - The network connection icon may not appear on the Windows taskbar [11].
                            - **Microsoft** 365 and **Office** apps may have activation [12] and network connection issues [13].
                            - **SQL Server** and **SQL Server Agent** services may fail to start [14].
                            - Network properties may not change or be managed efficiently [7].
                            - Other Windows services may fail:
                            - On Windows 10:
                                Network Location Awareness (`NlaSvc`) [4] [6], Remote Procedure Call (RPC) (`RpcSs`) [4] [6],
                                HomeGroup Provider (`HomeGroupProvider`) [4] [6], Microsoft App-V Client (`AppVClient`) [4] [6],
                                Network Connected Devices Auto-Setup (`NcdAutoSetup`) [4] [6].
                            - On Windows 11:
                                Network Store Interface Service (`nsi`) [5], Remote Procedure Call (RPC) (`RpcSs`) [5],
                                TCP/IP Protocol Driver (`tcpip`) [5], Microsoft App-V Client (`AppVClient`) [5],
                                Network Connected Devices Auto-Setup (`NcdAutoSetup`) [5]

                            NLS is responsible for NCSI functionality only on Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022 or later [3] [15].
                            Earlier versions like Windows Server 2019 and Windows 10 use Network Location Awareness (NLA) for NCSI [15].

                            Microsoft states that disabling NLS only affects network information display and does not impact system behavior [11].
                            Broadcom confirms that it is safe to disable this service [16].
                            The Center for Internet Security (CIS) recommends disabling this service [1].
                            Citrix recommends disabling this service on VDI\RDS machines [17].
                            However, Microsoft has not provided clear guidance on whether this service should be disabled [2] [8].
                            It states that the effects of disabling this service are not fully evaluated [2].

                            Despite recommendations from authorities, this script does not disable NLS on Windows 11.
                            Disabling NLS on Windows 11 causes your `explorer.exe` to crash and relaunch repeatedly [18].
                            These issues were last confirmed in tests on Windows 11 Pro 23H2.
                            The `explorer.exe` process repeatedly crashes, causing the screen to flash continuously and preventing the taskbar from loading.

                            > **Caution**: This may lead to:
                            > - Lack of immediate feedback on network status.

                        docs: |-
                            Windows Delivery Optimization is a feature introduced by Microsoft to facilitate a more efficient downloading process for Windows
                            updates, upgrades, and applications [1] [2]. Instead of exclusively relying on Microsoft's servers, this feature identifies other
                            PCs on a user's local network or even across the internet that already possess the desired updates or applications [2]. By breaking
                            the download into smaller segments and fetching each from the fastest and most reliable source, which can include other PCs, the
                            system ensures more efficient downloads [2]. To support this process, Delivery Optimization uses a local cache to temporarily store
                            downloaded files [2].

                            While Delivery Optimization is designed for speed and reliability, its operation raises privacy concerns. Specifically, when enabled,
                            it can distribute updates and applications from one user's PC to others [2], sharing users' data such as their IP addresses [3].

                            Benefits of disabling Delivery Optimization for privacy:

                            - **Minimizing Data Sharing**: By turning off Delivery Optimization, users ensure that updates and apps are neither downloaded from nor sent
                            to other devices [2]. This guarantees that all data remains strictly on the user's device [2] and the user IP is not shared [3].
                            - **Storage Conservation**: Users can save storage space by eliminating the local cache utilized by Delivery Optimization.
                            - **Guaranteed Source Authenticity**: Although Microsoft ensures the authenticity of updates and apps shared via Delivery Optimization [2],
                            disabling the feature guarantees that all updates and apps come directly from Microsoft's servers, eliminating potential intermediaries.
                            - **Bandwidth Conservation**: With the feature off, updates are restricted to direct downloads from Microsoft [1]. This is beneficial
                            for users on metered or capped internet connections, as it allows for more effective bandwidth monitoring [2].
                            - **Enhanced Security**: Devices using Delivery Optimization open port 7680 to accept peer requests [4]. Disabling the feature avoids this,
                            ensuring users are not exposed to unwanted inbound traffic and enhancing security [5].
                            - **VPN Protection**: Although Delivery Optimization attempts to detect VPNs and halts uploads when a VPN connection is detected [4], disabling
                            it removes any risk of unintended data sharing over a VPN.

                            Notably, the USA government [5] and Department of Defense (DoD) in the USA [6] recommends disabling this feature.

                                recommend: standard

                                    This script modifies Delivery Optimization's download method for Windows Updates [1] to disable peering. When this script is run, it sets the
                                    download method to `0`, which means "HTTP only, no peering" [1] [2]. As a result, Windows Updates are downloaded solely from the internet and
                                    not from other computers on the network (referred to as "peer-to-peer") [3].

                                    Peer-to-peer is a method where multiple computers share data amongst themselves. For Windows Updates, the default setting is for computers
                                    within a network to share updates (called LAN mode, represented by the value `1`) [1] [2].

                                    Changing the setting to "HTTP only" reduces potential vulnerabilities [3]. When updates are fetched only from official servers, there's
                                    less chance of unwanted or malicious data entering the system. This is why the Department of Defense (DoD) in the USA [4] and USA government [3]
                                    recommends this setting. They assert that leaving it in its default configuration could expose the system to additional risks [3].

                                    Delivery Optimization is a Windows feature that provides the Windows Updates through peer-to-peer sharing [1]. In simple terms, instead of solely
                                    relying on Microsoft's servers for updates, your computer can also fetch them from other devices that already possess the necessary files.

                                    The "Delivery Optimization" service manages these content delivery tasks [2] [3]. It orchestrates the retrieval of updates both from other Windows users [3].
                                    In doing so, it connects to various Microsoft service points to collect data, such as policies, content details, device specifications, and information about
                                    other Windows users [3]. This data sharing raises privacy concerns.

                                    This service also logs IP addresses [4] of peers which can be considered personal data. It listens on port 7680 for TCP/UDP traffic [5] that may expose the user
                                    to unwanted inbound traffic and enhancing security [6].

                                    By default, the "Delivery Optimization" service is set to start automatically when Windows boots up [2]. This script alters that behavior, ensuring
                                    it doesn't run unless explicitly started by the user.

                                    Taking control of this service prevents Microsoft from activating peer-to-peer sharing, enhancing user privacy. It ensures your device doesn't share update data
                                    or fetch it from arbitrary peers.

                                    > **Caution:** Disabling this service affects the functionality of Windows Store. It plays a role not just in Windows Updates but also in Microsoft Store app
                                    downloads, especially since Windows 11 [7]. There have been reported issues with some app downloads on Windows 10 [8].

                category: Disable Windows search data collection
                docs: |-
                    This category is dedicated to minimizing the personal data collected and utilized by Windows Search and Cortana.
                    It encompasses a range of scripts designed to curtail data sharing and bolster user privacy.
                    These scripts are crucial for preventing the search function from transmitting sensitive information such as
                    search history, account details, and location data to Microsoft's servers.

                    The Windows search functionality, often integrated with Cortana [1], is a key feature that allows for data collection
                    through various means. This includes gathering user searches, contacts, location data, voice inputs, browsing history,
                    and details from emails, calendars, and communication history [2].

                    The voice data thus collected aids in refining language understanding and machine learning models [2]. Furthermore,
                    Cortana's use of location data provides contextually relevant answers and suggestions, often estimating the user's
                    location via their IP address [2]. This feature extends to web browsing as well, where Cortana utilizes Microsoft Edge
                    browsing history for personalized suggestions [2].

                    Contacts, calendar details, and email information are also accessed by Cortana to track and offer tailored suggestions [2]
                    Additionally, when signed in, chat history with Cortana is retained, and typed searches are transmitted to Bing for
                    enhanced recommendation quality, even when Cortana is not actively in use [2].

                    By using the scripts in this category, users can significantly enhance their privacy and security.
                    These scripts enable users to control the extent of their personal data used by Windows, thereby ensuring a more secure
                    and private search experience.

                            This category targets the reduction of Cortana's data collection practices.

                            Cortana, Microsoft's digital assistant, integrates deeply with Windows Search to provide personalized
                            assistance based on user data.

                            By disabling Cortana's data collection features, this category aims to enhance user privacy by preventing the
                            sharing of sensitive information with Microsoft.

                            The scripts within this category provide users with the tools to limit Cortana's reach into their personal data,
                            thereby fostering a more private and secure digital environment.

                                    This category focuses on preventing Cortana from storing and displaying user interaction history.

                                    When enabled, Cortana collects data on user activities, such as interactions with the assistant and search queries,
                                    to personalize the user experience.
                                    This collection can be a privacy concern as it involves the retention and potential analysis of personal behavior patterns.

                                    By disabling this feature, users can prevent their activity history from being used for customization or other purposes,
                                    thereby enhancing their privacy and potentially improving system performance by reducing background data processing tasks.

                                    This category is designed to stop Cortana from listening for voice commands.

                                    By default, Cortana can actively listen for voice input, which may include capturing and processing speech patterns and
                                    potentially sensitive spoken content.
                                    This capability raises privacy issues as voice data is often processed and stored remotely.

                                    Disabling Cortana's voice listening features ensures that conversations or background noises are not inadvertently
                                    recorded or analyzed, providing users with a greater level of privacy in their personal or work environments.

                                    This disables remote access to the search index of your computer [1] [2] [3] [4].

                                    By executing this script, other computers will no longer be able to query your computer's search index remotely [1] [2] [4].
                                    This means that when others are browsing network shares on your computer, they cannot use its index for searching [1] [2] [4].
                                    By default, without this script, client computers can search using the host's index [1] [2] [3] [4], which might pose a privacy concern.

                                    Implementing this change is crucial for maintaining both the privacy and security of your search data.
                                    Not restricting this access is recognized as a security vulnerability [5].

                                    The script targets the following registry key to implement the change:
                                    `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Search!PreventRemoteQueries` [1] [2] [4] [5].

                                    This script enhances the security of Windows Desktop Search by restricting the use of iFilters and protocol handlers [1].

                                    These components enhance Windows search capabilities by enabling the indexing of specific file types and the processing
                                    of various file protocols [2] [3].
                                    By default, Windows Desktop Search can use any installed iFilters and protocol handlers [1], which might
                                    pose a security risk if untrusted components are used.

                                    The script configures the system to only use iFilters and protocol handlers that are explicitly listed in an 'allow list' [1].
                                    It does not prevent the installation of new iFilters or protocol handlers, nor does it restrict their use by other applications [1].

                                    This measure is particularly useful for preventing unauthorized or potentially harmful search-related add-ins from being used by
                                    Windows Desktop Search, thereby enhancing the overall security of the system.

                            This script blocks both the Windows search function and Cortana, Microsoft's virtual assistant, from
                            accessing your device's location data [1].
                            
                            By default, Microsoft processes location data, impacting user privacy [2].

                            The U.S. Internal Revenue Service advises restricting access to this data to improve security, given the
                            sensitivity of location information [3].

                            Once this script is applied, search and Cortana will no longer be able to provide results based on the user's
                            location [1], thus enhancing privacy.

                            The script accomplishes this by modifying the following registry keys:
                            
                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Search!AllowSearchToUseLocation` [1] [2]

                            These scripts are designed to limit the amount of personal data shared with Microsoft, preventing your

                                    This script disables the Bing search integration in the Windows Start menu search function [1] [2] [3].

                                    In Windows, typing in the Start menu search box displays results from the web via Bing, in addition

                                    By preventing the search function from sending queries to Microsoft servers, this script enhances user privacy
                                    and optimizes system performance by reducing the search workload.

                                    Running this script prevents such web searches by modifying the `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Search!BingSearchEnabled`
                                    registry key [1] [2] [3]. It is applicable to Windows version 1909 and older [1] [2] [4].

                                    By default [1] [2], search highlights present content like holidays, anniversaries, and other special events,
                                    both globally and regionally [1]. This feature, available since Windows 10 and 11 version 2004 [1] [3] [4],
                                    periodically updates with content, including illustrations and text in the search box [1].

                                    However, using search highlights can impact your privacy.
                                    This feature is even considered a security vulnerability [2].
                                    It reduces privacy by communicating personalized content including updates from
                                    your organization, suggested people, files, and more [3]. Acknowledging this privacy concern, Windows provides
                                    settings in the "Privacy & security" section to manage it [3].

                                    This script adjusts following registry keys to turn off this feature:

                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Search!EnableDynamicContentInWSB` [4] [2] [5]
                                    - `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SearchSettings!IsDynamicSearchBoxEnabled` [6] [7] [8]
                                    - `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SearchSettings!ShowDynamicContent` [7]

                            When executed, the script prevents the operating system from storing search queries in the registry [1] [2].
                            Consequently, suggestions based on previous searches will no longer appear in the search pane [1] [2].
                            However, suggestions based on local content from apps or Windows itself will remain available [1] [2].

                            The National Security Agency (NSA) in the USA recommends this setting for enhanced privacy and security [3].

                            By default, Windows provides search suggestions based on previous searches [1] [2] [4].
                            Running this script disables this feature, thereby enhancing privacy.

                            The script configures the following registry keys:

                            This script enhances privacy by limiting what search information is shared with Bing [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].

                            By default, Search in Windows shares user information, including search history, Microsoft account details, and location data,
                            to personalize search results and other Microsoft services [1] [2].
                            Executing this script ensures that search history, account details, or specific location data are not sent to Microsoft [1] [2].

                            Applicable to Windows 8.1 and later [1] [2] [3] [5], this script is a key privacy measure.
                            It is recommended by the US Department of Defense (DoD) and is considered a standard security practice [3].
                            Sharing this information is recognized as a security vulnerability [4].
                            The Center for Internet Security (CIS) also recommends this setting in its security framework [5].

                            The script modifies the following registry key to enforce this privacy setting:
                            `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Search!ConnectedSearchPrivacy` [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].

                            This script disables the integration of personal cloud content in the taskbar search box [1] [2] [3].

                            By default [2], Windows Search can access and display results from various Microsoft cloud services,
                            including OneDrive, Outlook, Bing, SharePoint [2] [3] [4] for both personal Microsoft accounts and
                            work or school accounts [1] [2] [3] [4].

                            This means your personal and work-related files stored on Microsoft's cloud platforms can be searched
                            through the Windows Search interface. While this feature increases convenience, it also poses privacy
                            concerns. For instance, someone with access to your computer can potentially view your personal search
                            results or data from your cloud storage. Additionally, your search queries are shared with Microsoft,
                            further impacting your privacy.

                            By disabling this feature, you ensure that Windows Search only returns results from your local device,
                            safeguarding your personal and professional information stored in cloud services. This action enhances
                            privacy by keeping your cloud-stored data separate from local search operations.

                            The script modifies two registry keys to disable cloud content search for different account types:

                            - For personal Microsoft accounts:
                              `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SearchSettings!IsMSACloudSearchEnabled` [1] [2] [3]
                            - For work or school accounts:
                              `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SearchSettings!IsAADCloudSearchEnabled` [1] [2] [3]

                                    The script disables the Windows Spotlight feature. Windows Spotlight is a feature in Windows 10 and Windows 11 [1] that automatically downloads
                                    and displays random wallpapers on the lock screen [1] [2]. These images are sourced from the internet [1] [2] [3]. At times, it might also promote
                                    various Microsoft products, services [1] [2], or even third-party apps and content [4].

                                    When the lock screen fetches images from the internet, there's a silent data exchange happening. This can inadvertently reveal details about the
                                    user's device or their preferences.

                                    To mitigate this potential privacy risk, the script makes a change to a key (`DisableWindowsSpotlightFeatures`) in the Windows operating system [3].
                                    Originally, Windows Spotlight is turned on unless the user decides otherwise [2].
                                    By applying this script, users can be sure their lock screen remains private and doesn't retrieve wallpapers from the internet, eliminating potential
                                    data leaks.

                        name: Disable participation in Visual Studio Customer Experience Improvement Program (VSCEIP)
                        recommend: standard
                        docs: |-
                            This script disables participation in the Visual Studio Customer Experience Improvement Program (VSCEIP),
                            enhancing your privacy and system performance.

                            Previously, VSCEIP was known as `PerfWatson` in Visual Studio [1].
                            It collects information about errors, hardware specifications, and usage patterns in Visual Studio [1] [2].
                            This data includes crashes, memory dumps, errors, stack traces, CPU and memory usage, interaction telemetry,
                            and other diagnostic data [2].
                            The collected information is sent to Microsoft servers for analysis [1] [2].

                            By default, VSCEIP data collection is enabled when Visual Studio is installed.
                            This means unless you actively opt out, Microsoft will collect and analyze your usage data.

                            By disabling VSCEIP, this script enhances your privacy by preventing Visual Studio from sending your usage
                            data to Microsoft.
                            It also improves system performance by reducing background data collection and transmission.

                            ## Technical Details

                            The script modifies registry keys for Visual Studio versions from 2015 to 2022 [3]:

                            | Version | Product            |
                            |:-------:|--------------------|
                            | 14.0    | Visual Studio 2015 |
                            | 15.0    | Visual Studio 2017 |
                            | 16.0    | Visual Studio 2019 |
                            | 17.0    | Visual Studio 2022 |

                            It sets the `OptIn` value to `0` in the following registry paths:

                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE[\Wow6432Node]\Microsoft\VSCommon\<Version>\SQM` [2]
                            - `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\VisualStudio\SQM` (for Group Policy enabled users) [2]

                            The script modifies both 32-bit and 64-bit paths, except for Visual Studio 2022, which is 64-bit only [4].

                            By default, Visual Studio 2022 (last tested on version 17.10.5 on Windows 11 23H2) sets the `OptIn` value to `1`,
                            meaning the user is opted in to the program.
                            This script changes that value to `0`, opting the user out [2].

                            Feedback tool in Visual Studio allows users to report a problem from either Visual Studio or its installer.
                            It collects rich diagnostic information along with personally identifiable information [1]. Information includes large log files,
                            crash information, screenshots, repro recording, and other artifacts [1].

                            This script disables feedback dialog and screenshot capture/email input that's prompted to be sent as part of the feedback.

                            set imply that feedback is enabled.

                            Visual Studio Standard Collector Service is a service that is part of
                            [Microsoft Visual Studio and .NET Log Collection Tool](https://web.archive.org/web/20231207105404/https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=12493) [1].
                            This service collects logs for Diagnostics Hub just like Diagnostic Hub Standard Collector [2].
                            It has been known to be vulnerable to privilege elevation [3] [4].

                            Disabling this service is recommended because otherwise it would:
                            - Increase the attack surface of your computer, making it open to potential future vulnerabilities.
                            - Use computer resources in favor of collecting more data about you and your behavior.

                            This script disables log collection by the Diagnostics Hub in Visual Studio.

                            The Diagnostics Hub is a feature that allows running multiple performance analysis
                            tools simultaneously [1].
                            This feature collects extensive data including CPU usage, user interface responsiveness,
                            and energy consumption. [1].
                            It presents data from multiple tools on a shared timeline, showing relationships between
                            different performance metrics [1].

                            The Diagnostics Hub collects additional logs [2] [3].
                            Microsoft recommends stopping this collection after necessary logs are collected [2] [3] [4] [5] [6].
                            It logs to a specified directory when enabled [2] [4] [5] [6].

                            Disabling this log collection improves privacy by reducing the amount of data collected
                            about your system and activities.
                            It also enhances security by limiting data accessible to attackers and reducing the attack
                            surface, given past vulnerabilities in this logging [7].
                            Additionally, it can improve system performance, as Microsoft warns that this logging is
                            resource-intensive [2].

                            This script deletes the `LogLevel` registry key at
                            `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\VisualStudio\DiagnosticsHub` [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [8].
                            Removing the `LogLevel` key effectively disables the Diagnostics Hub logging functionality [3] [4] [5] [6] [8].
                            In Visual Studio 2022 and later versions, these registry keys are not set by default after installation.

                            > **Caution:**
                            > Disabling this feature may impact the use of certain performance analysis tools in Visual Studio.
                            > Enable logging only when necessary if you need these tools for development.

                        docs: |-
                            This script prevents IntelliCode in Visual Studio from collecting data.
                            IntelliCode uses AI to suggest code improvements by analyzing usage and error reports [1].
                            In scenarios like team model training, user code is shared with Microsoft [2] [3] [4].
                            Opting out does not affect IntelliCode's local suggestion capabilities [3] [4].

                            By relying on local data models [3] [4], this script improves privacy, reducing the amount of data shared with Microsoft.
                            The script works by modifying registry keys to disable the feature that sends data to Microsoft for remote analysis [3].
                            By default, Visual Studio 2022 and newer versions do not contain these registry keys.

                            The backend servers for IntelliCode model training are discontinued, making the data collection feature outdated [5].
                            Thus, this script provides peace of mind for users of older Visual Studio 2022 versions, even though the feature is outdated.

                            This category contains scripts that disable Nvidia telemetry tasks. Telemetry tasks are programmed to transmit data, which
                            may encompass system performance details or error reports [1] [2]. By disabling these tasks, you can improve your privacy by ensuring
                            your system's data remains confidential and is not shared with external sources.

                category: Disable Microsoft Office telemetry
                docs: |-
                    This category includes scripts that disable various telemetry and data collection features in Microsoft Office applications.

                    Microsoft Office collects telemetry data to improve user experience and product functionality [1].
                    However, this data collection raises privacy concerns.

                    The scripts in this category aim to enhance user privacy by limiting or disabling the transmission of usage data,
                    diagnostic information, and other potentially sensitive details to Microsoft.

                    Disabling Office telemetry will:

                    - Enhance privacy by preventing the collection and transmission of user data.
                    - Potentially improve system performance by reducing background processes related to data collection.
                    - Reduce network usage associated with sending telemetry data.

                    Disabling telemetry may impact Microsoft's ability to provide personalized experiences, troubleshoot issues, or deliver certain updates.
                    However, for users prioritizing privacy, the benefits often outweigh these potential drawbacks.

                        recommend: standard
                        docs: |-
                            This script disables logging and data collection features in Microsoft Office applications.

                            It improves your privacy by preventing Office from recording and potentially sharing
                            information about your usage patterns and document activities.
                            This data may include details about the files you open, edit, or create.

                            The script may also improve system performance by reducing background processes
                            related to logging and data collection.

                            ### Technical Details

                            This script affects Office versions from 2013 to 2021 [1]:

                            | Version Number | Product Name |
                            | -------------- | ------------ |
                            | 15.0 | Office 2013 |
                            | 16.0 | Office 2016 |
                            | 16.0 | Office 2019 |
                            | 16.0 | Office 2021 |

                            The script modifies registry settings to disable:

                            - Mail logging in Outlook: `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\<Version>\Outlook\Options\Mail!EnableLogging`
                            - Calendar logging in Outlook: `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\<Version>\Outlook\Options\Calendar!EnableCalendarLogging`
                            - Logging in Word: `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\<Version>\Word\Options!EnableLogging`
                            - Office Software Management (OSM) logging: `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Office\<Version>\OSM!EnableLogging`
                            - Office Software Management (OSM) data upload: `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Office\<Version>\OSM!EnableUpload`

                            Tests on Office versions 2013, 2016, 2019, and 2021 confirm that these registry values are not present in a default installation.

                            This script disables telemetry data collection in Microsoft Office applications.

                            It improves your privacy by preventing Office from sending usage data and diagnostic
                            information to Microsoft.
                            This data may include details about your Office usage patterns, document content,
                            and system information.

                            The script may also improve system performance by reducing background processes
                            related to data collection and transmission.

                            ### Technical Details

                            The script modifies registry settings for multiple Office versions (Common, 15.0, and 16.0).
                            It includes (but not limited to) following products [1]:

                            | Version Number | Product Name |
                            | -------------- | ------------ |
                            | 15.0 | Office 2013 |
                            | 16.0 | Office 2016 |
                            | 16.0 | Office 2019 |
                            | 16.0 | Office 2021 |

                            The script modifies registry settings to disable:

                            - Telemetry: `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office[\<Version>]\Common\ClientTelemetry!DisableTelemetry`
                            - Verbose logging: `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office[\<Version>]\Common\ClientTelemetry!VerboseLogging`

                            Tests on Office versions 2013, 2016, 2019, and 2021 confirm that these registry values are not present in a default installation.

                            This script disables user participation in the Microsoft Office Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) [1].

                            The CEIP allows Microsoft Office users to send usage information to Microsoft [1].
                            When users join this program, Office applications transmit data to Microsoft about the user's interaction with the software [1].
                            Part of this data includes identifying details, such as the user's IP address used during the data transfer [1].

                            By default, when running Microsoft Office for the first time, users are given the choice to join the CEIP [1].
                            If they accept, their Office applications will periodically send usage statistics to Microsoft [1].

                            Implementing this script ensures:

                            - Users will not have the choice to participate in the CEIP [1].
                            - Office applications won't send any CEIP usage data to Microsoft [1].

                            Prioritizing privacy, the US Department of Defense (DoD) suggests this configuration to enhance the security and privacy of the operating system [2].

                            ### Technical Details

                            This modifies the `HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\<Version>\Common!QMEnable` policy setting [1] [2] [3].
                            If this policy is not configured, it acts as if the policy is set to `Enabled` [1].
                            This means that users are offered the choice to join the CEIP during their initial use of Office [1] [2].
                            This script sets this value to `0`, which disables the Customer Experience Improvement Program [1] [2] [3].

                            This script affects Office versions from 2013 to 2021 [4]:

                            | Version Number | Product Name |
                            | -------------- | ------------ |

                            | 16.0 | Office 2021 |

                            Tests on Office versions 2013, 2016, 2019, and 2021 confirm that these registry values are not present in a default installation.

                            This script disables feedback collection in Microsoft Office applications.

                            It enhances your privacy by blocking Office from collecting and sending your usage data to Microsoft.
                            This limits the personal information Microsoft receives about how you use Office.
                            It may also slightly boost system performance by removing background processes that collect feedback.

                            ### Technical Details

                        docs: |-
                            This script disables the scheduled tasks associated with the Office telemetry agent.

                            The Office Telemetry Agent, introduced in Office 2013, collects and uploads a variety of data for monitoring purposes [1].
                            This data includes runtime logs, properties of Office documents, and other insights from Office applications [1] [2].
                            Notably, it can upload file names, paths, and document titles in their original format [1].
                            The data is stored locally before being uploaded to a shared folder (at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Telemetry`) [3].
                            This poses privacy risks as it may contain personal or confidential information.

                            The `OfficeTelemetryAgentLogOn` scheduled task, collects data for the Office Telemetry Dashboard [1]. This task activates upon
                            user login to an Office client and continues to scan and collect data during the session [1]. The types of data collected encompass
                            file names of recently accessed Office documents [2] [3], names of add-ins and solutions interacting with Office [3], and system information
                            including user and computer names [2]. 

                            Disabling these tasks is recommended for enhancing privacy. The script effectively prevents privacy risks associated with telemetry
                            data collection by disabling the related scheduled tasks. It prevents the collection and upload of potentially sensitive information,
                            thereby protecting users from exposure of personal or internal process-related details.

                            This script disables the "Microsoft Office Subscription Heartbeat" scheduled task. 

                            The primary function of the Office Subscription Heartbeat task is to periodically check the subscription status of Microsoft Office products [1] [2],
                            verifying their licenses are active and valid [1]. This task actively communicates with Microsoft servers, transmitting Microsoft account data [3] for
                            license verification.

                            Disabling this task improves privacy as it prevents these regular communications and data transmissions, though it may lead to complications
                            regarding license compliance over time.

                            The task creates and utilizes cache files located at `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\vfs\Common AppData\microsoft\office\Heartbeat` [1]
                            and `%PROGRAMDATA%\Microsoft\Office\Heartbeat\HeartbeatCache` [3] [4], in `HeartbeatCache.xml` file [1] [4]. It executes the `OLicenseHeartbeat.exe` process
                            daily [2], also known as "Office Subscription Licensing Heartbeat" [2].

                            `\Microsoft\Office\Office 15 Subscription Heartbeat` (tested since Office version 2208):

                            | OS Version       | Default Status       |
                            | ---------------- | -------------------- |

                            | Windows 11 22H2  | 🟡 N/A (missing)     |

                            > **Caution:** Consider that while disabling this task may lead to increased privacy, it could also impact license compliance and the overall functionality
                            of Microsoft Office products in the long run.

                            This category contains scripts that adjust Microsoft Edge settings to enhance privacy, security,
                            and potentially improve system performance
                            
                            This category is designed for Chromium-based Edge only, not for legacy Edge.
                            Edge (Chromium) is the current version of Microsoft Edge, replacing Edge (Legacy) [1] [2].
                            It comes pre-installed on all Windows versions starting from Windows 10 20H2 [2].
                            Older versions are automatically upgraded to Edge (Chromium) through Windows updates [1].

                            Edge collects personal data, including browsing history, favorite sites, usage data, web content, and device
                            information [3].
                            This data is used for personal identification, targeted advertising, and product improvement, raising privacy concerns [3].
                            The scripts in this category are designed to enhance your privacy by offering options to disable data collection
                            and improve security while using Microsoft Edge.

                            These scripts enable you to configure Microsoft Edge to limit these data collection practices,
                            enhancing your online privacy, security, and system performance.

                                            This script disables the Edge Feedback feature in Microsoft Edge, enhancing user privacy by preventing feedback and data
                                            from being sent to Microsoft.
                                            
                                            The feature is enabled by default and cannot be disabled through standard browser settings [1] [2].
                                            When signed into Microsoft Edge with a work or school account, feedback is linked to the user's account and organization,
                                            potentially exposing sensitive information [1].

                                            Disabling this feature addresses privacy concerns by ensuring that feedback does not inadvertently share usage data or
                                            personal information with external servers.
                                            This may also improve system performance by reducing processing workload.

                                            Authorities like The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) [2] and The Center for Internet Security (CIS) [3]
                                            recommend this script for enhanced security.
                                            DISA categorizes the absence of this setting as a medium severity security vulnerability [2].

                                            Once applied, this script prevents the Edge Feedback feature from being used [1] [2].

                                            This script configures the `UserFeedbackAllowed` Edge policy [1] [2].
                                            The change takes effect after restarting the browser [1].

                                    This category encompasses scripts that disable automatic updates for Microsoft Edge and its WebView2 component.

                                    Disabling updates for Edge and WebView2 prevents automatic download and installation of new versions and patches.
                                    Both Edge and WebView2 share the same mechanisms for updates [1] [2].
                                    This mechanism is a way Microsoft collects user data [1].

                                    WebView2 uses Edge technologies to render web content within applications [3].
                                    It's widely integrated across various software products.
                                    This widespread integration exposes users to significant privacy risks associated with web browsing and data
                                    collection [4].

                                    Both Edge and WebView2 collect extensive user data, including browsing and download history [5] [6].
                                    Disabling updates blocks tracking features from being introduced, thus significantly enhancing your control
                                    over personal data privacy.

                                    Disabling updates increases privacy by reducing data shared with update servers.
                                    However, this could leave your system vulnerable to security risks if attackers exploit unpatched vulnerabilities in
                                    older versions.

                                    Disabling updates is beneficial if you do not rely on Edge or WebView2 daily, as it reduces unnecessary data
                                    transmission and unwanted system changes.

                                    > **Caution:** Disabling updates may reduce security if you use Edge and its components (WebView2).

                                            This script disables services responsible for automatically updating Microsoft Edge.

                                            It disables the `edgeupdate` [1] [2] [3] and `edgeupdatem` [1] [2] [4] services.
                                            These services keep your Microsoft software up to date [1] [3] [4].

                                            Disabling these services:

                                            - Enhances privacy by stopping automatic data transmission, preventing background data collection.
                                            - Improves system performance by reducing background processes.
                                            - Allows more control over which updates are installed.

                                            Keep in mind:

                                            - Security vulnerabilities and issues in Edge won't be fixed if updates are disabled [1] [3] [4]. 
                                            - Manual updates are still possible as these services start automatically for manual updates.

                                            - Enhances privacy by preventing automatic data transmission for updates.
                                            - Improves system performance by reducing background tasks.
                                            - Reduces your attack surface, as these tasks can be targeted by malware [4].

                                            However, remember that disabling updates means security vulnerabilities in Edge won't be fixed automatically;
                                            manual updates will be necessary.

                                            > **Caution:** Disabling updates may lead to decreased security if you rely on Edge and its components (WebView2).

                                            This script disables the Microsoft Edge Update executable to enhance your privacy and control over system updates.

                                            `MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` is responsible for updating Microsoft Edge as part of the Microsoft Edge Update system [1] [2] [3].
                                            It's also responsible for updating Edge WebView2 [3].

                                            Blocking this executable:

                                            - Enhances privacy by preventing communication with the update server [4] [5].
                                            - Increases security by giving you control over software installations.
                                            - Boosts system performance by reducing background processes.
                                            - May decrease security if you rely on Edge or WebView2, as missing updates can lead to security vulnerabilities.

                                            Executable locations:

                                            - `%PROGRAMFILES(x86)%\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\<version>\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe` [4]

                                        docs: |- # refactor-with-variable: Same • Edge Update Caution • Chromium Policy Caution • Active Directory only • Edge Channels
                                            This script prevents Microsoft Edge from automatically updating across all channels.

                                            Microsoft Edge offers four update channels—Stable, Beta, Dev, and Canary—each designed with different stability
                                            levels and update frequencies [1].
                                            This script disables updates for all of these channels.

                                            This script applies only to Windows devices within a Microsoft Active Directory domain or managed in similar way [2] [3].
                                            It is effective only on computers under organizational management, such as those in workplaces or schools.
                                            It's not applicable to personal computers that are not managed by an organization.

                                            Disabling automatic updates enhances privacy by controlling data sharing during updates and improves
                                            system performance by reducing background activities.

                                            If you use Edge, manually check for and distribute updates after using this script to maintain security [2] [3] [4].

                                            This script configures update policies for different Edge channels:

                                            - `UpdateDefault` to configure all channels [3].
                                            - `56EB18F8-B008-4CBD-B6D2-8C97FE7E9062` for Edge (Stable) [2] [4] [5].
                                            - `2CD8A007-E189-409D-A2C8-9AF4EF3C72AA` to Edge (Beta) [2] [4] [6].
                                            - `65C35B14-6C1D-4122-AC46-7148CC9D6497` to Edge (Canary) [2] [4] [7].
                                            - `0D50BFEC-CD6A-4F9A-964C-C7416E3ACB10` to Edge (Dev) [2] [4] [8].
                                            - `F3C4FE00-EFD5-403B-9569-398A20F1BA4A` to Edge Insider [9].

                                            > **Caution:**
                                            > - Disabling updates may reduce security if you use Edge and its components (WebView2).

                                            This script disables automatic updates for Microsoft Edge WebView components.

                                            Microsoft Edge WebView and WebView2 Runtime are components that enable applications to display web content [1] [2].
                                            By default, these components receive updates automatically [1] [2].

                                            Running this script will prevent automatic downloading and application of updates for both older WebView [1] and newer WebView2 [2].
                                            This action might lead to compatibility issues with applications relying on the latest features of WebView [1] [2].

                                            This script configures `Update{F3017226-FE2A-4295-8BDF-00C3A9A7E4C5}` Edge Policy [1] [2].

                                            This script stops the Microsoft Edge Update agent from automatically checking for updates.

                                            This script prevents the Microsoft Edge Update agent from performing any automatic update checks [1].
                                            This includes updates for all Edge applications [2], including WebView2.
                                            Disabling these updates enhances privacy by eliminating the regular network activity initiated
                                            by Microsoft Edge Update [2]. It can also improve performance due to the reduction of background
                                            network operations.

                                            If you choose not to run this script, Microsoft Edge will continue to check for updates every 10 hours [1].
                                            Although disabling updates can enhance privacy, it may compromise security, particularly if you rely
                                            on Edge and its components like WebView2.
                                            Automatic updates help ensure that the browser and its components receive stability and security updates promptly [1].

                                            This script configures `AutoUpdateCheckPeriodMinutes` [1] [2] Edge policy.
                                            Setting to `0` disables all periodic network traffic by Microsoft Edge Update [1] [2].

                                            If you do not run this script, Microsoft Edge checks for updates periodically throughout the day by default [1] [2].
                                            This script limits update checks to the least frequent interval permitted by policy settings.
                                            This reduces network traffic and decreases system load, thereby enhancing both privacy and performance.

                                            However, this delay in updates can expose you to security risks, especially if you depend on Edge for critical tasks.
                                            Keep in mind, automatic updates play a crucial role in protecting your system against emerging security threats.

                                            The script configures the `UpdatesSuppressedDurationMin`, `UpdatesSuppressedStartHour`, and `UpdatesSuppressedStartMin`

                                            to maintain control over software installations on their systems.
                                            These scripts help ensure that Edge and its components like WebView and WebView2 are only installed when explicitly

                                                    This script disables the automatic installation of Microsoft Edge across all update channels, enhancing
                                                    user control over their systems and privacy.

                                                    Microsoft Edge offers four update channels—Stable, Beta, Dev, and Canary—each designed with different stability
                                                    levels and update frequencies [1].
                                                    This script blocks automatic installations for all these channels [2] [3].
                                                    This allows users to manually manage their updates and potentially reduce exposure to unstable or privacy-intrusive software.

                                                    This script applies only to Windows devices within a Microsoft Active Directory domain or managed in similar way [2] [3].
                                                    It is effective only on computers under organizational management, such as those in workplaces or schools.
                                                    It's not applicable to personal computers that are not managed by an organization.

                                                    This script configures update policies for different Edge channels:

                                                    - `InstallDefault` to configure all channels [3].

                                docs: |-
                                    This category contains scripts to disable Copilot features in Microsoft Edge.

                                    Copilot, initially known as *Bing Chat* [1], integrates generative AI into Edge [1] [2].
                                    Despite its capabilities, it raises significant privacy and security concerns:

                                    - **Privacy Concerns**:
                                      Microsoft may retain chat data, which could include sensitive information [2].
                                      It also collects personal data, such as URLs, page titles, user queries, and browsing context [2].
                                    - **Security Risks**:
                                      Language models like those used in Copilot are susceptible to specific attacks and vulnerabilities [3].
                                      Read more: [Attacks on language models](https://erkinekici.com/articles/attacks-on-language-models/).
                                    - **Targeted Advertising**:
                                      Copilot can display targeted ads based on chat interactions, raising further privacy issues [4].

                                    Disabling Copilot capabilities bolsters privacy, reduces security threats, improves browser speed, and provides
                                    a cleaner browsing experience.

                                            This is a launcher bar on the right side of Microsoft Edge's screen [1].
                                            By default, the Sidebar is visible [1], but running this script will permanently hide it [1].

                                            Disabling the Hubs Sidebar also deactivates the following features:

                                            - **Copilot in Edge**:
                                                This feature was known as *Bing Chat* [2], *Discover in Edge* [3] [4], *Bing Discover* [3],
                                                *Discover app* [5], *Discover experience* [4], or simply *Discover* [3] [4].
                                                It collects personal data including URLs, page titles, user queries, browsing context, and
                                                conversation histories [6] [7].
                                                It enables the discovery of content relevant to the page you are browsing, such as summaries and
                                                source information [4].
                                                Disabling the Hubs Sidebar is the recommended method to also disable Copilot in Edge [4] [8].
                                                Disabling it stops this data collection, improving your privacy.
                                            - **Sidebar apps**:
                                                Disabling the Hubs Sidebar also deactivates all sidebar apps [5].
                                                This script disables also the sidebar in Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) [5].
                                                This script prevents all sidebar apps from being activated [5].
                                            - **Standalone Sidebar**:
                                                Disabling the Hubs Sidebar also turns off any standalone sidebar modes [9].
                                                This mode displays the Sidebar in a fixed position on the desktop, separate from the browser frame [9].
                                                Disabling this reduces background resource usage, thereby optimizing system performance [10].

                                            The script configures the following Edge policies:

                                            | Edge policy                               | Affected Edge versions       |
                                            |-------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
                                            | `HubsSidebarEnabled` [1] [3] [5] [8] [11] | Edge ≥ 99 [1]                |
                                            | `StandaloneHubsSidebarEnabled` [9] [10]   | Edge ≥ 88 and ≤ 119 [9]      |

                                            The new settings will take effect after you restart the browser [5].

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > - This will display the message "Your browser is managed by your organization" on the settings page.
                                            > - This locks settings and prevents them from being changed on the settings page.

                                            This script limits data access for Copilot in Microsoft Edge to enhance user privacy.

                                            This script blocks Copilot's access to web pages in the Edge sidebar [1] [2] [3].
                                            This stops Microsoft from collecting page contents, browser history, and user preferences [2] [3].
                                            Otherwise, this data would automatically be sent to Bing [1].
                                            This setting is specific to Microsoft Entra ID profiles [2], previously called AAD profiles [1].
                                            Additionally, this script applies to "Copilot with Commercial Data Protection" [3]

                                            By default, Copilot has access to page contents [1] [2] [3].
                                            This access enables summarizing pages and interacting with text selections [1] [2].
                                            This feature was previously known as **Discover** [1] and is based on Bing Chat [1].

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > Disabling this feature will disable Copilot's abilities to summarize pages and
                                            > interact with text selections in Edge.

                                            The script configures the following Edge policies:

                                            | Edge policy                         | Affected Edge versions        |

                                            | `CopilotPageContext` [2]            | Edge ≥ 124 [2]                |
                                            | `CopilotCDPPageContext` [2]         | Edge ≥ 124 [2]                |

                                            This script disables the Copilot access on the new tab page of Microsoft Edge.
                                            
                                            Originally known as Bing Chat, Copilot is a generative AI solution developed by Microsoft, integrated
                                            directly into the Edge browser [2].
                                            By default, the new tab page in Edge features two access points to Copilot: within the search box and in
                                            the Bing Autosuggest drawer upon clicking [1].

                                            Without this script, these Copilot entry-points remain active, offering AI-driven assistance directly
                                            from the new tab page [1].
                                            Running this script removes these, ensuring a simpler, distraction-free new tab page experience
                                            in Microsoft Edge [1].

                                            This script configures the `NewTabPageBingChatEnabled` Edge policy [1].

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > - This will display the message "Your browser is managed by your organization" on the settings page.
                                            > - This locks settings and prevents them from being changed on the settings page.

                                            This script disables the outdated Discover feature in Microsoft Edge.

                                            Initially called *Bing Chat* [1] [2] or *Bing Discover* [2], this feature has evolved into what is now known as **Copilot** [1] [2].
                                            In recent versions of Edge, the Discover button in the toolbar has been replaced with the new Copilot button [2].

                                            This script is applicable only to versions of Edge between 97 and 105 [3].
                                            It disables the obsolete Discover feature and button on older versions of Edge [3] [4].
                                            When enabled, this feature used to send URLs to Microsoft Bing to search for related content [3].
                                            By default, the Discover feature remains accessible in earlier Edge versions [3].

                                            This script configures the `EdgeDiscoverEnabled` Edge policy [3] [4].

                                    This category blocks several types of advertisements in Microsoft Edge,
                                    such as promotional suggestions, notifications, and recommendations.

                                    ### Impact

                                    - **User Experience**:
                                      Provides a cleaner, less distracting browsing experience.
                                    - **Privacy**:
                                      Enhances privacy by reducing potential tracking mechanisms.
                                    - **Performance**:
                                      Improves system performance by reducing unnecessary processing.

                                    ### Scope

                                    - **Targeted Ad Blocking**:
                                      Disables only those ads that can be suppressed without affecting other features.
                                    - **Feature Integrity**:
                                      Blocks ads selectively, ensuring the functionality of Edge's features is not compromised.
                                    - **External Ads**:
                                      Does not affect advertisements displayed by external websites.

                                            This script disables spotlight recommendations in Microsoft Edge to enhance privacy protection.

                                            By default, Microsoft Edge offers spotlight experiences and recommendations [1] [2] [3].
                                            These include personalized background images, text, suggestions, notifications, and tips based on your browsing activities [1] [2] [3].
                                            These features collect data about you and your interactions with Microsoft services [1].

                                            Disabling these recommendations helps protect your privacy by preventing Microsoft from using your browsing data to personalize and display content [1].
                                            This is especially important because such data could inadvertently be exposed or shared with unauthorized third parties [1].

                                            The Center for Internet Security recommends disabling these features as they consider them a potential security risk [1].

                                            This script configures the `SpotlightExperiencesAndRecommendationsEnabled` [2] [3] Edge policy.

                                            After running this script, users will no longer receive any spotlight experiences or recommendations from Microsoft Edge [1] [2] [3], maintaining
                                            a more generic and less intrusive browsing environment.

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > - This will display the message "Your browser is managed by your organization" on the settings page.
                                            > - This locks settings and prevents them from being changed on the settings page.

                                            This script disables promotional notifications and feature recommendations in Microsoft Edge, providing a distraction-free browsing experience.

                                            By default, Microsoft Edge may show notifications encouraging users to explore various features [1] [2],
                                            such as using vertical tabs for improved tab management [1].
                                            These notifications typically appear in situations like having multiple tabs open [1], and can include suggestions
                                            to link Edge with a smartphone [3] or to use Bing as a search engine in Chrome [4].

                                            Running this script stops these notifications [1], ensuring users do not receive prompts even in scenarios where they are
                                            typically triggered [1].

                                            Such recommendations may pose privacy concerns by potentially tracking user interactions and preferences.
                                            By disabling these features, the script helps safeguard user privacy by reducing exposure to tracking mechanisms.

                                            This action is beneficial for those who prefer a less intrusive interface while browsing.
                                            Microsoft recommends this script for users who favor a streamlined browser setup without unsolicited suggestions or interruptions [2].

                                            This script configures the `ShowRecommendationsEnabled` [1] [2] Edge policy.

                                            > **Caution**:

                                            This script blocks all advertisements on Bing when using Edge,
                                            enhancing the search experience by eliminating interruptions and unwanted content.

                                            By default, `bing.com` displays ads within search results [1].
                                            This intrudes on privacy by tracking user behavior.
                                            This script blocks these ads [1], providing a cleaner and more private search environment.

                                            It also sets the SafeSearch filter to 'Strict' [1].
                                            This limits adult content for safer browsing, particularly in educational settings.
                                            The 'Strict' setting may also limit the accessibility of some legitimate search results,
                                            which can affect search efficiency.

                                            Once applied, these settings cannot be changed by the user [1], solidifying the search environment
                                            configuration. You will need to run the revert script.

                                            This script applies only on K-12 SKUs identified as educational tenants by Microsoft [1].
                                            It is effective only in educational institutions recognized by Microsoft.

                                            This script configures the `BingAdsSuppression` [1] Edge policy.
                                            The changes will take effect upon the next restart of the Edge browser [1].

                                            This script disables full-tab promotional content in Microsoft Edge.

                                            By default, Microsoft Edge may display full-tab content [1] [2].
                                            These promotions may include product feature highlights, sign-in assistance, default browser selection, or tutorials on new features [1] [2].
                                            This content can include welcome pages and educational material [1] [2].

                                            Running this script modifies the `PromotionalTabsEnabled` policy [1] [2] to prevent Microsoft Edge from showing this
                                            type of promotional content. After executing the script, Edge will no longer display these full-tab promotions [1] [2].

                                            This improves user privacy by reducing exposure to unsolicited promotional material and helps streamline the browsing experience
                                            by eliminating potential distractions. Additionally, it improves system performance by reducing the load times associated with
                                            these promotional tabs.

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > - This will display the message "Your browser is managed by your organization" on the settings page.
                                            > - This locks settings and prevents them from being changed on the settings page.

                                            This script stops Microsoft from personalizing ads and content using your browsing data across its services,
                                            thereby enhancing your privacy.

                                            Microsoft Edge collects and transmits your browsing history, favorites, usage data, and other web activities to Microsoft [1] [2] [3].
                                            This data is used to personalize advertisements and content to your interests [1] [2] [3] [4].
                                            This information is shared with other Microsoft services, such as Microsoft Edge, Bing, and News [1] [2] [3] [4].
                                            For instance, based on your activity, Microsoft may show you ads for products from stores you frequently visit or
                                            news related to topics you often read about [1] [3].

                                            By executing this script, you prevent Microsoft from utilizing your browsing data to personalize ads and content [1].
                                            This ensures your browsing habits are kept private and not used for advertising purposes.

                                            Authorities like The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) [5] and The Center for Internet Security (CIS) [6]
                                            recommend this script for enhanced security.
                                            DISA categorizes the absence of this setting as a medium severity security vulnerability [5].

                                            This setting is applicable only to personal Microsoft accounts and does not apply to child or enterprise accounts [2] [4].
                                            Once applied, the setting cannot be altered by the user, indicating that the browser is being managed [2] [4].

                                            This script configures the `PersonalizationReportingEnabled` [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Edge policy.

                                            > **Caution**:

                                            By default, Edge displays content promoting its Insider channels on the "About Microsoft Edge" settings page [1].
                                            Running this script prevents these promotional materials from appearing [1] [2].

                                            Disabling these ads helps maintain a more private and less cluttered browsing interface.
                                            Microsoft recommends this script for users who favor a streamlined browser setup without unsolicited suggestions or interruptions [2].

                                            This script configures the `MicrosoftEdgeInsiderPromotionEnabled` Edge policy to stop these promotions [1] [2] [3].

                                            This script removes the Adobe Acrobat subscription button from Microsoft Edge's PDF viewer.

                                            In 2023, Microsoft integrated Adobe's PDF viewer into Edge and added a subscription button
                                            for purchasing Acrobat services [1].
                                            This button is visible by default [2] and prompts users to subscribe to Adobe Acrobat,
                                            offering access to premium features [1] [2].

                                            This script conceals the subscription button, thus preventing direct prompts to
                                            purchase Adobe's premium services from the PDF viewer [1].
                                            This action creates a cleaner interface and minimizes commercial distractions.

                                            This script configures the `ShowAcrobatSubscriptionButton` [1] [2] Edge policy
                                            to hide the subscription button.

                                            This script disables the display of default top sites and sponsored links on Microsoft Edge's new tab page, enhancing privacy by
                                            eliminating commercial content and preventing the exposure of your frequently visited sites.

                                            By default, Microsoft Edge displays tiles of frequently visited sites, known as top sites, on the new tab page [1].
                                            These sites, saved from your browsing history, facilitate quick access to frequently visited destinations [2].
                                            The display also includes sponsored links [3], which are advertisements.

                                            Running this script will hide these default top site tiles and remove all sponsored quick links from the new tab page [3].
                                            Removing these links helps minimize tracking from your visits and interactions with ads, promoting a more private browsing environment.
                                            Microsoft recommends this script for users who favor a streamlined browser setup without unsolicited suggestions or interruptions [4].

                                            Furthermore, removing these top sites and sponsored links protects sensitive browsing data from exposure to others, including friends,
                                            family, and potential attackers, maintaining your privacy and security.

                                            This script configures the `NewTabPageHideDefaultTopSites` Edge policy [1] [3] [4].
                                            Running this script does not require a browser restart for the changes to take effect [1].

                                    This script disables the Follow feature in Microsoft Edge.

                                    The Follow feature in Edge allows users to receive updates from influencers, websites,
                                    or topics directly in the browser [1].
                                    By default, this feature is enabled [1].
                                    The feature sends the URLs of websites you visit to Microsoft's Bing API, compromising privacy [2] [3].
                                    It risks exposing sensitive information, such as search terms and personal details.
                                    It creates a personalized feed in Edge's Collections by collecting browsing data [4].
                                    To protect privacy, it's advisable not to send browsing data to third parties [4].

                                    Disabling this feature stops Edge from sending visited URLs to Microsoft [2] [3],
                                    and prevents communication with the Follow service [1],
                                    keeping browsing data private and local.

                                    The Center for Internet Security (CIS) advises disabling this feature to bolster security [4].

                                    This script configures the `EdgeFollowEnabled` Edge policy [1] [3] [5].
                                    Running this script does not require a browser restart for the changes to take effect [1].

                                    This script disables Microsoft Edge's shopping features.
                                    Microsoft refers to these features as *shopping assistant* [1] [2] [3] [4], *shopping features* [2] [5], or *Microsoft Shopping* [5].

                                    These features allow users to compare prices, receive coupons, and use autofill during checkout to speed up the process [2].
                                    They also provide notifications for coupons and rebates when shopping online [5].

                                    Disabling these features addresses several privacy concerns:

                                    - **Data Collection and Profiling:**
                                      Microsoft collects extensive data about users' shopping habits and online activities.
                                      This includes users' shopping habits [5], preferences [5], websites visited [4] [5], and search history [4].
                                      This contributes to detailed user profiling.
                                    - **Continuous Network Communication:**
                                      The browser continuously communicates with Microsoft servers.
                                      It receives retailer information [5].
                                      It sends data about visited shopping sites and system details to Microsoft servers [5].
                                    - **Email Scanning:**
                                      Microsoft Edge scans users' email accounts for promotional coupons [5].
                                      The email data sent may include sensitive information.
                                    - **Targeted Advertising and Tracking:**
                                      Collected data can be used to tailor precise ads, enhancing targeted advertising efforts.
                                      Edge modifies URLs for affiliate tracking, which aids persistent online tracking [5].
                                    - **Persistent Cookies:**
                                      Persistent cookies are used for various functions including debugging, fraud detection, and analytics [5], further compromising
                                      user privacy.
                                    - **Data Sharing:**
                                      Data is shared with Bing Rebates and Shopping services [5], potentially exposing sensitive user information to third parties [4].
                                      This aggregation of data could lead to more detailed collection of personal information.

                                    Running this script prevents the automatic activation of features such as price comparison, coupons, and express checkout on retail websites [2].

                                    Authorities like The Center for Internet Security (CIS) [1] [4] recommend this script for enhanced security.
                                    Microsoft recommends this script for users who favor a streamlined browser setup without unsolicited suggestions or interruptions [3].

                                    This script configures the `EdgeShoppingAssistantEnabled` Edge policy to disable Edge's shopping features [1] [2] [3].

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > - This will display the message "Your browser is managed by your organization" on the settings page.

                                    This script disables the **Search bar** feature.
                                    This feature is formerly known as **Edge bar** [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] and **Web Widget** [1] [2] [3] [4] [6] [7].

                                    This feature allows users to perform web searches directly from their desktop or within applications [5] [8].
                                    The search is powered by Bing [6] [7], or the default search engine of Microsoft Edge [6] [7] [8].
                                    It provides search and URL suggestions [6] [7] [8].
                                    It also displays personalized news and content such as headlines, weather, sports, traffic, along with some tools [4] [5].
                                    Users can access the Search bar from the "More tools" menu or jump list in Microsoft Edge [6] [7] [8].

                                    The Search bar is enabled by default across all profiles unless disabled [6] [7] [8].
                                    It does not start at Windows startup by default [1] [2] [9].

                                    This feature raises privacy concerns as it collects data to provide personalized content [4] [5].
                                    Once opened, it remains active even after you close Microsoft Edge [3].
                                    You must explicitly close it using the "Quit" option in the System tray or the 3-dot menu [6] [7].

                                    Running this script will disable:

                                    - The Search bar [6] [7] [8].
                                    - The option to launch the Search bar from Microsoft Edge "More tools" menu [6] [7] [8]
                                    - The option to launch the Search bar from Microsoft Edge jump list menu [6] [7] [8]
                                    - Automatical launch of the Search bar at Windows startup [1] [2] [9].
                                    - The option to start the Edge bar at Windows startup in Microsoft Edge settings [1] [2] [9].

                                    The script configures the following Edge policies:

                                    This script disables Microsoft Rewards in Edge.

                                    This feature is enabled by default, activating the Microsoft Rewards experience in Edge [1].
                                    Users participating in search and earn markets will notice this feature within their Microsoft Edge user profile [1] [2].

                                    Microsoft Rewards encourages users to earn points through Bing searches, which can be redeemed for items at the Microsoft Store [1].
                                    However, this feature involves tracking user activities, which may pose privacy risks by potentially sharing sensitive data with third parties [1].
                                    
                                    Running this script prevents Microsoft Rewards notifications and features from appearing in Edge [1], enhancing privacy.
                                    The script modifies the `ShowMicrosoftRewards` policy to turn off these features [2] [3]
                                    It's recommended for those who prefer not to have their search activities monitored or used for advertising purposes.
                                    The Center for Internet Security suggests disabling these features, viewing them as a potential security risk [1].

                                    After applying this script, the Microsoft Rewards experience will no longer be visible in the Edge user profile [1].
                                    Changes will take effect after restarting the browser [3].

                                    > **Caution**:

                                    This script disables suggestions from Microsoft Search in Bing within the address bar.
                                    This enhances privacy by reducing unsolicited data sharing with Bing.

                                    By default, Microsoft Edge may display results powered by Microsoft Search in Bing within the address bar suggestions [1] [2].
                                    This occurs even if Bing is not the default search provider [1].
                                    This feature can raise privacy concerns, as it involves sending query data to Bing.

                                    This script stops the display of Microsoft Search in Bing suggestions in the address bar as users type their search terms [1] [2].
                                    It modifies the `AddressBarMicrosoftSearchInBingProviderEnabled` Edge policy [1] [2].

                                    This script specifically targets Bing suggestions without affecting other search providers [1] [2].
                                    Additionally, the script disables internal search results for users logged in with an Entra ID (Azure AD) within their organization [1] [2].

                                    The changes take effect after restarting the browser [1].

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > - This will block the display of internal search results within an organization when logged in.

                                    This script stops Edge from sending data to Microsoft during 'Find on Page' searches, enhancing privacy.

                                    'Find on Page' allows users to search for text on a webpage, highlighting matches and suggesting related terms [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].
                                    This feature sends data to Microsoft for processing [1] [3] [4].
                                    This data transmission is enabled by default [1] [3].
                                    The data includes the text of the webpage, search terms, and a service token [5].
                                    Sharing browsing and search history may expose data to third parties [3].

                                    After applying this script, the 'Find on Page' feature remains usable, but without sending data to Microsoft [1] [3].
                                    Instead, all related matches are generated on the user's device, significantly enhancing privacy without sacrificing functionality.
                                    Local processing minimizes exposure of sensitive data and aligns with security best practices from the CIS (Center for Internet Security) [3] [6].

                                    This script configures the `RelatedMatchesCloudServiceEnabled` Edge policy [1] [3] [4] [6].

                                    This prompt, which resembles advertising, can compromise your privacy by encouraging the sharing of
                                    personal information.

                                    After applying this script, the sign-in prompt will no longer appear on the new tab page [1].

                                            This script configures Microsoft Edge's tracking prevention to the 'Strict' level,
                                            enhancing user privacy by blocking extensive web tracking

                                            The tracking prevention feature in Microsoft Edge restricts online trackers from accessing
                                            browser storage and network resources, which helps safeguard user data [1].
                                            By default, the 'Balanced' level is activated [1] [2].
                                            While the 'Balanced' level does not block ads or analytics [1], this script activates the 'Strict'
                                            level to provide a higher degree of privacy by blocking these elements [1].
                                            Although recommended for maximum privacy, the 'Strict' level may disrupt some website functionalities [3] [4].

                                            Authorities like The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) [4] and The Center for Internet Security (CIS) [2]
                                            recommend this script for enhanced security.
                                            DISA categorizes the absence of this setting as a medium severity security vulnerability [4].

                                            Once applied, this script prevents users from changing the tracking prevention level themselves [3] [4].

                                            This script configures the `TrackingPrevention` Edge policy [1] [2] [3] [4].
                                            Running this script does not require a browser restart for the changes to take effect [2].

                                            It prevents websites from setting cookies unless they match the domain in the address bar [1].

                                            This script enables Do Not Track requests in Microsoft Edge.

                                            Do Not Track communicates to websites that you prefer not to have your browsing activity tracked [1].
                                            It enhances privacy by signaling your tracking preferences to websites, though compliance is not guaranteed.

                                            By default, Edge does not send Do Not Track requests [1].
                                            This script ensures these requests are always sent to websites that seek tracking information [1].

                                            Additionally, Microsoft endorses this script as it helps create a cleaner browser interface by reducing

                                    When you type in the address bar, Microsoft Edge sends characters to Microsoft servers to provide search

                                    This data-sharing feature is enabled by default [1].
                                    Running this script prevents these suggestions from appearing [3].
                                    It ensures your inputs remain private and are not used to generate suggestions or telemetry [1] [2].

                                    - Blocks the collection of typed characters and visited URLs for telemetry by Microsoft [1] [2].
                                    - Retains local history and favorites suggestions, without sending this data to Microsoft [1] [2].

                                    This script disables the display of quick links on the new tab page in Microsoft Edge.

                                    By default, Microsoft Edge displays quick links on the new tab page [1].
                                    This feature provides one-click access to your most frequently visited sites by automatically adding them to this menu [2].

                                    Running this script will hide these quick links and disable the user's ability to modify this setting in the NTP settings flyout [1].

                                    This may reduce convenience as users will need to manually enter website addresses, but it enhances privacy by preventing
                                    the inadvertent exposure of frequently visited sites.

                                    The changes made by this script apply only to Microsoft Edge profiles associated with local user accounts, Microsoft Accounts,
                                    or Active Directory accounts [1]. They do not affect Enterprise new tab pages configured through Azure Active Directory [1].

                                    This script configures the `NewTabPageQuickLinksEnabled` Edge policy [1] [2].

                                    This script disables background images recevied by Microsoft servers on new tab.

                                    By default, if you do not run this script, all background image types on the new tab page are enabled [1] [2].
                                    It allows using custom image disabling only daily background image type [1] [2].

                                    Disabling this feature removes unecessary network traffic with Microsoft servers that may leak data
                                    and your usage of behavior. It also optimizes system by simplifying the browser usage and removing nunnecssary network traffic.

                                    This script configures the `NewTabPageAllowedBackgroundTypes` Edge policy to value `1` (`DisableImageOfTheDay`) [1] [2].

                                    This script disables the Collections feature in Microsoft Edge.

                                    By default, if this script is not executed, users can access and use the Collections feature in Microsoft Edge [1].
                                    The Collections feature in Edge compiles and manages web content—articles, images, and videos—for activities like shopping, trip planning, or research [2] [3].
                                    This feature syncs across devices when logged into Microsoft Edge, keeping your collections updated no matter where you access the browser [2].
                                    The Collections feature enables efficient collection, organization, sharing, and exporting of content, with seamless integration into Office [1] [4].
                                    The feature lets users save and categorize web pages, text, images, and videos into groups for specific projects or interests [3].
                                    Additionally, it enhances saved items with thumbnails and metadata, such as price and star ratings [3].

                                    This feature raises several privacy concerns:

                                    - Microsoft analyzes saved web pages to understand item names and primary images [3].
                                    - Data is stored on Microsoft servers once a user signs into Edge [2].
                                    - Microsoft analyzes data from Collections to personalize advertising and user experiences [5].

                                    Authorities like The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) [4]
                                    recommend this script for enhanced security.
                                    DISA categorizes the absence of this setting as a medium severity security vulnerability [4].

                                    Running this script prevents access to this feature [1] [6], thereby mitigating associated privacy risks and
                                    adhering to security recommendations

                                    This script configures the `EdgeCollectionsEnabled` Edge policy [1] [4] [6].
                                    This change only takes effect after restarting the browser [6].

                                    This script prevents Microsoft Edge from sending data to Microsoft and
                                    suggesting alternatives when URLs fail to load.

                                    By default, Edge contacts a web service to suggest URLs and searches upon
                                    encountering network errors like DNS failures [1] [2] [3].

                                    This feature presents several privacy concerns, including:

                                    - Exposing the websites a user visits [4]
                                    - Redirecting to potentially malicious sites if the service is compromised [4].

                                    Authorities like The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) [2]
                                    recommend this script for enhanced security.

                                    Running this script ensures:

                                    - Edge will not request suggestions from the web service but will display
                                      a standard error page instead [1] [2] [3].
                                    - Once applied, users cannot change the setting [1] [2] [3].

                                    This script disables the outdated games menu in older versions of Microsoft Edge.

                                    The games menu in Microsoft Edge offers one-click access to various free-to-play casual and arcade games,
                                    including Microsoft Solitaire, Microsoft Jewel, Microsoft Mahjong, and the Microsoft Edge Surf Game [1].
                                    In modern versions, this menu is integrated into the sidebar [2] [3].

                                    Disabling the games menu leads to a less cluttered browser interface.
                                    Microsoft recommends this script for those favoring a streamlined browser setup without unsolicited suggestions or interruptions [3].
                                    Minimizing unnecessary features enhances security and privacy by reducing data exposure and attack surface.
                                    Moreover, removing these features can improve system performance by reducing resource usage.

                                    This script targets older versions of Edge where games were accessible from the options menu [1].
                                    By default, this menu is enabled and accessible on these versions [2].
                                    It configures the `AllowGamesMenu` Edge policy to prevent access to the games menu [2] [3].

                                    The in-app support allows users to contact Microsoft support directly from the browser [1].
                                    This feature is enabled by default, activating the Microsoft Rewards experience in Edge [1].
                                    It cannot be disabled by users through the standard browser settings [1].
                                    This feature leads to sharing of browser usage data with Microsoft.
                                    Microsoft support agents directly from the browser [1].

                                    Microsoft recommends this script for users who favor a streamlined browser setup without unsolicited suggestions or interruptions [3].

                                    This script configures the `InAppSupportEnabled` Edge policy [1] [2] [3].

                                    This script disables Microsoft Edge's AutoFill feature for payment data and suppresses payment-related advertisements, 
                                    enhancing privacy by preventing the storage and suggestion of unsolicited financial information.

                                    By default, Microsoft Edge allows users to save and autofill payment information, such as credit and debit card details,
                                    for quicker transactions in web forms [1] [2].
                                    This script prevents the browser from storing new payment data [1] [2] and stops suggestions for financial instruments like
                                    'Buy Now, Pay Later' options during checkout [1].

                                    Authorities like The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) [2] and The Center for Internet Security (CIS) [3]

                                    DISA categorizes the absence of this setting as a medium severity security vulnerability [2].

                                    Furthermore, Microsoft recommends the use of this script for a cleaner browser interface free from unsolicited suggestions [4]
                                    and to improve privacy by controlling data connections [5].

                                    This script disables the Experimentation and Configuration Service in Microsoft Edge, effectively stopping
                                    automatic updates and data exchanges that are typically used for testing new features and optimizing the user
                                    experience.

                                    This service sends payloads to Edge that may contain experimental features and settings recommendations designed
                                    to improve user experience [1].
                                    It may also change the browser's behavior on specific websites, for example, by overriding the User Agent string [1].

                                    By default, the service operates in `FullMode`, downloading both experimental and configuration data [1].
                                    In certain configurations, the service may download only the settings recommendations (`ConfigurationsOnlyMode`) [1].
                                    Disabling this service through this script sets it to `RestrictedMode`, meaning no data will be sent back
                                    to Microsoft [2], and no payloads will be delivered [1].

                                    This setting is recommended by authorities like The Center for Internet Security (CIS) for enhanced security [2]
                                    and by Microsoft to control data connections more securely [3].

                                    This service can potentially compromise privacy because it involves sending data back to Microsoft,
                                    which includes feedback on development features and actions taken on certain domains [2].
                                    It can also deliver a payload that contains a list of actions to take on certain domains [2].

                                    This script configures the `ExperimentationAndConfigurationServiceControl` Edge policy [1].
                                    Running this script does not require a browser restart for the changes to take effect [1].

                                    Startup Boost enables Edge to launch more quickly by allowing certain processes to start at OS sign-in [1].
                                    It keeps running in the background even after all browser windows are closed [1] [2].
                                    While this can decrease the browser's start time [2], it might also pose privacy and security risks.

                                    Disabling this feature prevents Edge from starting automatically with your computer, enhancing privacy
                                    by stopping the background processes that could transmit data without active user interaction.
                                    This also bolsters security by ensuring no residual or malicious scripts continue to operate after the browser is closed [3].
                                    Additionally, it may improve system performance by freeing up resources otherwise used by these background processes.

                                    The Center for Internet Security (CIS) recommends disabling this feature to secure personal data and reduce potential
                                    vulnerabilities [3].

                                    This script configures the `StartupBoostEnabled` Edge policy [1] [4].
                                    Running this script does not require a browser restart for the changes to take effect [1].

                                    This script disables the automatic use of a web service for resolving navigation errors in Microsoft Edge.

                                    By default, Microsoft Edge contacts a web service to diagnose connectivity issues, especially in public
                                    networks such as those in hotels and airports [1] [2].
                                    This functionality can unintentionally reveal network-related information, potentially including sensitive
                                    personal data [2].

                                    The Center for Internet Security (CIS) recommends deactivating this feature to prevent potential privacy breaches
                                    and security threats from network data leaks [2].

                                    Running this script ensures that Edge relies solely on native APIs to handle network connectivity and navigation errors,
                                    enhancing privacy by not transmitting data to external services [1] [2].
                                    It ensures that all navigational errors are managed locally without external web services, maintaining the resolution
                                    process entirely within the system [1] [2].

                                    This action does not impede Edge's ability to resolve connectivity issues using its native capabilities [1] [2].

                                    This script configures the `ResolveNavigationErrorsUseWebService` Edge policy [1].
                                    Running this script does not require a browser restart for the changes to take effect [1].

                                    This script disables the Family Safety settings in Microsoft Edge.

                                    Microsoft Family Safety collects personal information such as names, email addresses, birth dates, and other
                                    diagnostic data [1].
                                    By default, Edge features a dedicated family settings page and offers a Kids Mode for safer browsing experiences
                                    tailored for children [2].

                                    This script:

                                    - Removes the Family page from the settings menu, which provides information on features associated with Microsoft Family Safety [2].
                                    - Blocks navigation to the `edge://settings/family` URL [2].
                                    - Disables Kids Mode, a child-friendly environment that includes custom themes and restricted browsing, and requires a device password to exit [2].

                                    Disabling these features helps protect privacy by preventing the collection of personal and diagnostic data associated with family settings.
                                    It prevents the unintentional sharing or management of children's browsing data and other sensitive details via Edge's Family Safety protocols.

                                    This script configures the `FamilySafetySettingsEnabled` Edge policy [2].
                                    Running this script does not require a browser restart for the changes to take effect [2].

                                    Although intended to enhance security by providing detailed website information [3], this feature also collects data
                                    about your visits, posing privacy risks.
                                    This script stops Edge from displaying this information [1], enhancing your privacy by reducing data transmission to Microsoft.
                                    It prevents Microsoft from automatically querying or storing information about the sites you visit, thereby
                                    maintaining greater control over your personal browsing data.

                                    This script disables Live Tile data collection in Edge (Legacy).

                                    **Live Tiles**, a feature within UWP apps, automatically collect and display updated information
                                    directly on the Start menu, without opening the app [1].
                                    The Live Tiles feature, once available on Windows 8.1 and 10 [2], has been replaced by the
                                    **Widgets** feature in Windows 11 [3].

                                    By default, pinning a Live Tile to the Start menu allows Microsoft Edge to collect and send metadata to Microsoft [4] [5] [6].
                                    This script prevents Edge from sending this metadata [4] [5] [6].
                                    It also blocks the collection of Live Tile metadata from `ieonline.microsoft.com` when you pin a Live Tile to the Start menu [6].
                                    This limitation may affect the user experience [4] [5] [6].

                                    Disabling this feature reduces potential privacy risks by preventing data sharing.
                                    This may also improve system performance by reducing processing workload.

                                    This script configures the `PreventLiveTileDataCollection` policy [4] [5] [6].
                                    This script only applies to Edge (Legacy) and does not impact newer versions of Edge.

                                    This script disables the search suggestions feature in the Address bar of Edge (Legacy).

                                    By default, typing in the Address bar of Edge (Legacy) displays search suggestions [1] [2] [3],
                                    potentially compromising privacy by sending typed data to Microsoft.
                                    
                                    This script prevents such data sharing by disabling the search suggestions feature [1] [2] [3].
                                    As a result, users will no longer receive search suggestions when typing in the Address bar,
                                    thereby enhancing privacy [1] [2] [3] [4].

                                    Disabling this feature reduces potential privacy risks by preventing data sharing.
                                    Microsoft recommends this action to reduce their data collection to protect your privacy [4].
                                    This may also improve system performance by reducing processing workload.

                                    This script configures the `ShowSearchSuggestionsGlobal` policy [1] [2] [3] [4].
                                    This script only applies to Edge (Legacy) and does not impact newer versions of Edge.

                                    By default, Edge collects basic telemetry data based on your device settings [1].

                                    the Books feature.

                                    This script configures the `EnableExtendedBooksTelemetry` Edge policy [1].

                                    This script disables the Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) in Internet Explorer [1].

                                    The CEIP allows users to send information about their use of the software to Microsoft [2]. However, the CEIP does not
                                    collect users' personal details like names or addresses, only the IP address used to send the data [2].

                                    By applying this script:

                                    - Users will no longer be able to participate in the CEIP [1].
                                    - The option "Customer Feedback Options" will be removed from the "Help" menu [1].

                                    This script achieves its purpose by modifying a policy setting under the
                                    `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\SQM!DisableCustomerImprovementProgram` key [1] [2] [3]. Notably,
                                    this specific setting doesn't exist by default [2]. If left unconfigured (i.e., the setting doesn't exist), users have
                                    the option to join the CEIP [1] [2].

                                    Disabling CEIP participation enhances privacy by preventing the sending of usage information and personally identifiable
                                    information except such as the the IP address.

                                    For added credibility, the US Department of Defense (DoD) also recommends this configuration to improve the
                                    security [2] [3].

                            - **Search and Navigation Data**: Data typed into the omnibox for search predictions [1].
                            - **Autofill and Payment Information**: Information about web forms, passwords, and payment methods stored for autofill [1].
                            - **Sync Data**: Browsing history and other browser settings synced across devices [1].
                            - **Incognito and Guest Mode Data**: Data not saved when using these browser modes [1].

                            This data collection raises privacy concerns because it can be used for personal identification,
                            targeted advertising, and product improvement [1].
                            Additionally, Google Chrome may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information with third parties
                            like publishers and advertisers [1].

                            These scripts enable you to configure Google Chrome to limit these data collection practices,
                            enhancing your online privacy, security, and system performance.

                                    This script blocks the execution of the Chrome Software Reporter Tool, enhancing your privacy by preventing
                                    unnecessary data transmissions to Google, and boosting system performance through reduced resource consumption.

                                    This tool is also known as the *Software Reporter Tool* [1] [2] [3], *Software Reporter Tool for Chrome Cleanup* [4],
                                    *Chrome Cleanup Tool* [2] [3] and *Software Removal Tool* [2].
                                    It exists in Google Chrome [1] versions prior to v111 [3].
                                    Newer versions of Google Chrome do not include this tool [3].

                                    This tool scans for harmful software that may disrupt Chrome's operations [1] [3] [5] [6].
                                    It automatically removes software that degrades your browsing experience [1] [3] [5] [6].
                                    It can connect to the Internet, monitor applications, record keyboard and mouse inputs, and manipulate other programs [2].
                                    It reports findings to Google [1] [3] [4], which raises privacy concerns due to potential data collection and online reporting.

                                    The Software Reporter Tool may also significantly consume CPU and memory resources [1] [3] [4] [5], potentially leading to performance issues.
                                    By disabling it, you reduce CPU and memory usage, potentially speeding up your computer.

                                    It is located in the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\SwReporter` directory [1] [2] [3] [5].
                                    Its executable name is `software_reporter_tool.exe` [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6].
                                    This file reappears with each update of Chrome [3].
                                    Instead of deleting or moving the file, the script blocks its execution to ensure it remains disabled after Chrome updates.

                                    Disabling this feature reduces potential privacy risks by preventing data sharing.
                                    This may also improve system performance by reducing processing workload.

                                    Disabling this tool protects your privacy by:

                                    - Preventing sending scan results to Google [1] [3] [4].
                                    - Some malware disguise themselves as `software_reporter_tool.exe` [2] so running this script will also protect you against these.
                                    - This outdated component [3] may contain known vulnerabilities; disabling it helps mitigate these security risks by reducing your attack surface.

                                    > **Caution**: Disabling this component may limit Chrome's ability to automatically detect and remove problematic software.

                                            This script stops the Chrome Cleanup Tool from sending scan data to Google, enhancing privacy.

                                            By default, when the Chrome Cleanup Tool detects unwanted software, it reports metadata about the scan and the software to Google [1] [2].
                                            The reported data includes file metadata, automatically installed extensions, and registry keys [1] [2].
                                            Users can choose to share cleanup results with Google to enhance future software detection [1] [2].

                                            Disabling this feature reduces potential privacy risks by preventing data sharing.
                                            This may also improve system performance by reducing processing workload.

                                            Authorities like The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) [2]
                                            recommend this script for enhanced security.
                                            DISA categorizes the absence of this setting as a medium severity security vulnerability [2].

                                            This script applies only to Windows devices within a Microsoft Active Directory domain or managed in similar way [1] [2].
                                            It is effective only on computers under organizational management, such as those in workplaces or schools.
                                            It's not applicable to personal computers that are not managed by an organization.

                                            This script configures the `ChromeCleanupReportingEnabled` policy [1] [2].
                                            Changing this policy does not require restarting the browser to take effect [1].

                                            This script disables Chrome system cleanup scans to enhance user privacy and improve system performance.

                                            By default, Chrome Cleanup Tool periodically scans the system for unwanted software and prompts the user for removal [1] [2].
                                            This feature can also be manually triggered from the `chrome://settings/cleanup` page [1] [2].

                                            Running this script stops the Chrome Cleanup Tool from performing system scans and cleanups [1] [2],
                                            which protects your system's information from being analyzed and shared.
                                            It also disables the manual trigger of this feature from the settings page [1] [2].

                                            Disabling this feature reduces potential privacy risks by preventing data sharing.

                                    This script disables Chrome's metrics reporting, enhancing user privacy and system performance.

                                    By default, Chrome may send anonymous usage and crash-related data to Google [1] [2].
                                    If no user preference is set, Chrome follows the initial choice made during installation or first run [1] [2].

                                    This script ensures that anonymous reporting of usage and crash-related data is stopped, preventing this data from
                                    being sent to Google [1] [2].
                                    Additionally, it locks this setting, making it immutable by users [1] [2].

                                    Disabling this feature reduces potential privacy risks by preventing data sharing.
                                    This may also improve system performance by reducing processing workload.

                                    This script disables the Firefox *Default Browser Agent*.
                                    The agent collects and sends information about the user's default browser to Mozilla [1]
                                    Disabling it halts the transmission of details such as the currently set default browser, the previous one,
                                    and the operating system's locale and version number [2] [3].

                                    This enhances privacy by preventing browser preferences and usage data from being shared with Mozilla.

                                    The script configures `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox!DisableDefaultBrowserAgent` registry key to
                                    prevent the Default Browser Agent from taking any actions [4].

                category: Disable Google background automatic updates
                docs: |-
                    This category includes scripts to manage the automatic updates of various Google products in background.
                    These products include Google Chrome, Google Earth, along with other applications [1].

                    This category aims to give users control over the automatic update processes running in the background,
                    without disabling manual updates or affecting the overall functionality of Google products [1].

                    Google Chrome checks for, downloads, and installs updates in the background [2], without requiring user interaction [2].
                    This includes constant network communication in background with Google servers, which reveals data about your device
                    and usage behavior.

                    By using the scripts provided, users can stop automatic update services and scheduled tasks related to Google software updates.
                    This empowers users to initiate updates at their discretion, ensuring they have the final say in what gets installed on their systems.

                            This script disables the "Google Update Service" services.
                            These services are identified as `gupdate` and `gupdatem` [1] [2] [3].
                            They are responsible for keeping Google software up to date by initiating updates [4].
                            They are linked to the `GoogleUpdate.exe` executable located in the `%PROGRAMFILES%\Google\Update` directory [5] [6] [7].

                            The services operate based on a client/service model, where the client requests services to conduct updates [1].
                            Despite both services being named "Google Update Service" [3] [8] [9], they are associated with different aspects of updating.
                            The `gupdate` service is linked to regular update check [2] [5] [7], while `gupdatem` is connected to medium level service updates [2] [5] [6].

                            According to Google's documentation, these services play a crucial role in maintaining the software's security and functionality [3].
                            These services will uninstall themselves if no Google software is utilizing them [3].

                            However, there are privacy and security concerns associated with these services. They continuously run in the background, sending data back to Google [10] [11],
                            and they log Event Logs [12] [13] [14] [15] [16], which reveals information about the system's state. There have also been vulnerabilities found in these services
                            in the past, adding an additional layer of risk [17].

                            Disabling these services do not affect manual updates as these services are started for manual updates automatically [4].

                            Often administrators choose to delete these services to prevent auto-updates [9], a practice that is acknowledged by the Google team [9].
                            By disabling these services, this script aims to give users more control over their system and mitigate potential privacy and security risks, albeit at the cost
                            of not receiving automatic software updates from Google.

                            This script disables the scheduled tasks used by Google to automatically update its software on Windows.

                            The Google Update service creates two main tasks [1]:

                            - `GoogleUpdateTaskMachineCore`: Initiates automatic updates [2].
                            - `GoogleUpdateTaskMachineUA`: Corresponds to "Updates app" [3].

                            In newer versions of the Google Update service, these task names have random suffixes appended to them [4].

                            Both of these tasks call the executable file `C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Update\GoogleUpdate.exe` [5] [6].
                            This process is officially named as "Google Installer" [7] or "Constant Shell" [8].
                            It is responsible for handling updates [9] [10].

                            Disabling these tasks can impact the functionality of the "Google Credential Provider for Windows" (GCPW) service [11] [12].
                            GCPW is a tool used to manage devices with Google endpoint management [13].
                            This tool is typically used to offer access to Google Workspace services on managed computers [13].
                            It allows users to sign in to a Windows 10 or 11 device using their Google Account for work or school [14].

                            These tasks are described by Google as following [15]:

                            > Keeps your Google software up to date. If this task is disabled or stopped, your Google software will not be kept up to date, meaning security
                            > vulnerabilities that may arise cannot be fixed and features may not work. This task uninstalls itself when there is no Google software using it.

                    This category includes scripts designed to disable Adobe's background automatic update services and tasks.
                    These automatic updates run in the background [1], typically starting up with your PC, and work to keep your Adobe software up to date [1].
                    By disabling them, you optimize your system's performance, reduce unwanted data collection, and minimize your vulnerability surface.
                    These scripts only disable automatic updates; manual updates are still possible.

                            This script disables the `adobeupdateservice` service.
                            This service is responsible for updating Creative Cloud desktop apps [1] [2].
                            It runs continuously in the background [3].
                            It manages the privileges required for various actions, such as installing app updates and syncing fonts [3].
                            This allows Adobe to perform its actions without prompting you for your system password or approval [3].

                            This service has had vulnerabilities in the past, including the Privilege Escalation Unquoted Service Path
                            vulnerability [4], making it a potential security risk.

                            The service's executable is typically found at
                            `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\Adobe Desktop Common\ElevationManager\AdobeUpdateService.exe` [1] [2].

                    This script disables the `Razer Game Scanner Service`.

                    The service is part of the **Razer Synapse** software suite [1] [2].
                    It runs the `GameScannerService.exe` process [3] [4].
                    This process scans your computer for installed games to optimize Razer device settings
                    and saves all settings to the cloud [2].

                    Disabling this service enhances privacy by preventing data transmission to Razer servers.
                    It also improves system performance by reducing heavy resource usage [1] [2] [3].

                    Recent versions of the Razer Synapse software no longer include this service (last tested on version 3.9.311).

                    intended to keep Dropbox up to date, they can be intrusive and use system resources unnecessarily. Disabling them does not prevent updates,

                    to manually update Dropbox to ensure they have the latest version and security features.

                                docs: |- # refactor-with-variables: Same • Key Size Caution • handshake
                                    This script improves your security by setting the `Diffie-Hellman` [1] [2] [3] key exchange
                                    to a minimum of 2048 bits.
                                    This is a secure way to exchange keys over public networks.

                                    This script only affects the *SSL/TLS handshake* process.
                                    The *SSL/TLS handshake* is a key part of establishing a secure connection over the internet.
                                    By disabling this weak algorithm, the script improves the security of the connection.

                                    By default, modern Windows versions use a 2048-bit size for Diffie-Hellman key exchanges [1].
                                    Sizes under 1024 bits are considered weak [4] [5].
                                    NIST in USA [4] and Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) in Germany [3] disallows usage of sizes
                                    under 2048 bits.
                                    NSA (National Security Agency) recommends at least 3072 bits [6].

                                    This script hardens your system's security by using keys of adequate strength, following best practices.

                                    This script improves your security by enforcing a minimum of 2048 bits for RSA encryption keys (`PKCS` [1] [2]).
                                    RSA encryption keys play a crucial role in securing communications over the internet.
                                    The Public-Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) define how to use RSA keys for secure communication encryption.
                                    Using keys that are too weak can expose your data to unauthorized access.

                                    This script only affects the *SSL/TLS handshake* process.
                                    The *SSL/TLS handshake* is a key part of establishing a secure connection over the internet.
                                    By disabling this weak algorithm, the script improves the security of the connection.

                                    From Windows 10, version 1507, and Windows Server 2016 onwards, the default RSA key size is 1024 bits [2].
                                    However, this script raises the client-side minimum to 2048 bits, aligning with modern security standards.
                                    Server-side RSA key strength relies on the server certificate [2].

                                    Since 2013, internet standards and regulatory bodies have banned 1024-bit RSA keys due to security vulnerabilities [3].
                                    These entities, including the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) in Germany [2] and the National Institute of Standards
                                    and Technology (NIST) in the USA [4] [5], now recommend the use of keys that are 2048 bits or longer.
                                    RSA key exchanges of 2048 bits or are widely accepted.

                                    In 2012, Microsoft deprecated 1024-bit RSA keys for their applications [5] [6] and will end support for them in
                                    Windows by March 2024 [3].

                                    While 2048-bit keys balances security with efficiency [7], a shift towards stronger 4096-bit RSA keys is emerging.
                                    Projects like Debian [8], Fedora [9], and CaCert.org [10] use larger keys for long-term tasks.

                                    However, this script disrupts connections to Hyper-V virtual machines, which still require 1024-bit keys [11].
                                    It does not affect other virtual environments such as Docker, WSL, or Windows Sandbox [11].

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > - The script prevents access to Hyper-V VMs.
                                    > - Using bigger keys increases security but may not work with some old or less secure apps.
                                    > - This can make your device slower and drain the battery faster.

                                    This category improves network security by disabling outdated and less secure cipher suites.

                                    **Cipher suites** are sets of cryptographic algorithms used to secure network connections [1].
                                    They include **ciphers**, known as **bulk encryption algorithms** [1] or simply **bulk ciphers** [2].
                                    Ciphers encrypt messages exchanged between clients and servers [1].
                                    Using outdated cipher suites exposes data to risks of interception and tampering during transmission [2].

                                    Disabling insecure ciphers meets security standards set by NIST [3], CIS [4], IRS [5], OWASP [6]
                                    and Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) [7].
                                    This enhances data confidentiality and integrity [4].
                                    It also protects against threats such as attackers exploiting cryptographic weaknesses, malicious insiders,
                                    state actors, and cybercriminals [8].

                                            This script disables the `Triple DES 168` [1] [2] [3] (`Triple DES 168/168` before Windows Vista [2] [4]) cipher,
                                            also known as *3DES* [1] [3] [5] [6], *The Triple Data Encryption Algorithm (TDEA)* [6] [7] and **TDES** [8].

                                            This script only affects the *SSL/TLS handshake* process.
                                            The *SSL/TLS handshake* is a key part of establishing a secure connection over the internet.
                                            By disabling this weak algorithm, the script improves the security of the connection.

                                            Authorities like Apple [5] [9], NIST [5] [7] Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) [4],

                                            classify this cipher as weak and recommend against its use.

                                            This algorithm is enabled by default on Windows [2].

                                            Disabling 3DES secures your communication by mitigating vulnerabilities like Sweet32 Birthday attacks [5],
                                            and the limited amount of data that can be processed under a single key [6].

                                            Disabling this algorithm will disallow the following cipher suites:

                                            - `SSL_CK_DES_192_EDE_CBC_WITH_MD5` [1]

                                            This algorithm provides no encryption [1] [5], leaving data completely unprotected.

                                    This category includes scripts to disable insecure hash algorithms during cryptographic operations.

                                    Hash algorithms are essential for internet security, electronic banking, and document signing.
                                    Insecure hashes, however, are susceptible to collision attacks [1] [2].
                                    This vulnerability enables attackers to spoof content, perform phishing, or execute man-in-the-middle attacks [3] [4].
                                    Consequently, an attacker could intercept or modify data transmitted over what is believed to be a secure connection, without being detected.
                                    For instance, attackers could exploit this to divert your payments to their accounts, creating significant risks.

                                            This script disables `SHA` [1] [2] [3] hash algorithm, also known as *Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA-1)* [2].

                                            This script only affects the *SSL/TLS handshake* process.
                                            The *SSL/TLS handshake* is a key part of establishing a secure connection over the internet.
                                            By disabling this weak algorithm, the script improves the security of the connection.

                                            This algorithm is vulnerable to collision attacks [4] [5] [6] [7].
                                            This vulnerability enables attackers to spoof content, perform phishing, or execute man-in-the-middle attacks [8].
                                            Consequently, an attacker could intercept or modify data transmitted over what is believed to be a secure connection, without being detected.
                                            For instance, attackers could exploit this to divert your payments to their accounts, creating significant risks.

                                            Authorities like NIST (FIPS) [2], Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) [3], Mozilla [5], Microsoft [8],
                                            Google [4] [9] [10], OWASP [11], Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) [12], and Apple [13]
                                            classify this algorithm as weak and recommend against its use.

                                            Disabling this algorithm disallows the following cipher suites:

                                    This script enhances your security by reducing risks associated with secure communications.
                                    By running this script, you proactively enhance your online privacy and secure against
                                    well-known TLS vulnerabilities.

                                    TLS secures internet communications.
                                    It allows parties such as browsers and websites to update their encryption settings through **renegotiation** [2].
                                    Without safeguards, attackers could intercept and compromise these
                                    communications [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6].

                                    Insecure renegotiation can let attackers hijack communications from the start, enabling
                                    unauthorized control [1],
                                    data manipulation [3] [6],

                                    and identity spoofing [4] [5] [6].

                                    To counter these threats, this script implements measures standardized in RFC 5746 [1] [2], effectively
                                    closing the loophole that allowed these vulnerabilities.

                                    This script enhances security by blocking insecure renegotiation attempts and
                                    aims to improve compatibility with older software.
                                    It modifies the following system settings to achieve this:

                                    This category focuses on enhancing user privacy by disabling legacy and insecure communication
                                    protocols.
                                    It targets protocols that expose users to security vulnerabilities due to their outdated nature.

                                    Retaining obsolete protocols creates a false sense of security because they may seem secure but are
                                    vulnerable to exploitation [1].

                                    Authorities like NIST [1] (FIPS [2]), NSA (National Security Agency) [1],
                                    Office of the Chief Information Security Officer [2], Microsoft [3], Mozilla [4],
                                    PCI Security Standards Council [5], the Center for Internet Security [6],
                                    and IETF [9]
                                    recommend disabling insecure and obsolete protocols.

                                    Most modern operating systems [3] and browsers [4] disable these protocols by default.
                                    However, certain protocols remain active on some Windows systems [3] [7], posing security risks.
                                    It is crucial to disable these protocols to mitigate risks from well-known attacks such as
                                    POODLE [5] and BEAST [5].

                                    This category excludes the following protocols:

                                    - **DTLS 1.1**:
                                    DTLS 1.1 does not exist [8] [9];
                                    its numbering was skipped to align with TLS versioning [8].
                                    - **TLS 1.2**, and **DTLS 1.2** (based on TLS 1.2 [8]):
                                    TLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.2 are enabled by default on Windows [7] and are approved by authorities like
                                    NIST [2], and German Federal Office for Information Security [10].
                                    Disabling them could affect application functionality, and earlier versions are not
                                    widely supported by Windows [7] [10].

                                            This script improves network security by disabling the outdated SMBv1 protocol.

                                            **SMBv1**, or **Server Message Block version 1**, is an outdated network protocol developed
                                            for file and printer sharing across networks [1] [2].
                                            This protocol is well-known for its vulnerabilities to cyber attacks [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].
                                            Microsoft deprecated SMBv1 in 2014 [6] [7].
                                            Since 2007, newer and more secure versions of this protocol have
                                            replaced SMBv1 in modern versions of Windows [6].
                                            It is still enabled by default in older Windows versions [1].
                                            Microsoft advises disabling this protocol to strengthen security [1] [8].
                                            SMB1 is not necessary for most users, as Microsoft ensures vendor support for at least SMB 2.0 [2].

                                            The primary reasons for disabling SMBv1 include:

                                            - It uses the outdated MD5 hash algorithm, vulnerable to security attacks [3].
                                            - It fails to meet modern security standards set by FIPS [3], CISA (US-CERT) [5],
                                            CIS (Department of Defense) [3], and Microsoft Security Baseline [8].
                                            - It lacks the efficiency and performance improvements present in newer versions of the protocol [2].
                                            - It is vulnerable to various cyber threats [1] [2] [3] [4] [5],
                                            , including ransomware and malware [1] [2].

                                            Disabling SMBv1 may lead to compatibility issues with older network devices and software [1] [3] [6] [9].
                                            This may affect file sharing and print services on systems like Windows Server 2003 [3]
                                            and some older Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices [3].
                                            These systems are insecure and are no longer supported.

                                            This script makes the following changes to your system:

                                            - Removal of SMBv1 components:
                                            - `SMB1Protocol` [2] [3] [4] [10] (also known as `FS-SMB1` [2] [11])
                                            - `SMB1Protocol-Client` [10]
                                            - `SMB1Protocol-Server` [10].
                                            - Disabling the `mrxsmb10` (SMB 1.x MiniRedirector [12]) driver,
                                            linked with SMBv1 [1] [4] [13],
                                            and adjusting related settings to keep older systems stable [1] [4] [13].
                                            - Disabling server side processing of SMBv1 protocol using
                                            `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters!SMBv1` registry key [1] [14] [15].

                                            These changes require a system reboot to take effect [1] [4] [9].

                                            > **Caution:** This may cause compatibility issues with older devices or software.

                                        docs: |- # refactor-with-variables: Same • Compatibility Caution
                                            This script enhances your network's security by turning off NetBIOS over TCP/IP for all network interfaces.

                                            NetBIOS is a protocol primarily used for backward compatibility with older Windows systems [1] [2].
                                            NetBIOS and LLMNR are susceptible to hacking techniques like spoofing [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] and man-in-the-middle
                                            attacks [1] [2] [6], risking your credentials and unauthorized network access [2] [5] [6].

                                            NetBIOS was initially created for communication between applications in small networks [1] [3] [5] [7].
                                            Its lack of authentication makes it easy for attackers to redirect traffic or fake network services [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6].

                                            Disabling NetBIOS helps protect against these security risks and reduces the exposure of Windows-specific services
                                            to potential attackers.

                                            The script disables NetBIOS by changing a specific registry values
                                            (`HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\NetBT\Parameters\Interfaces\{Interface}!NetbiosOptions` [1] [8]) from their default

                                            This protocol is identified as `TLS 1.1` on Windows [1] [2] [3].

                                            Although deprecated and unsupported in newer Windows versions [4],
                                            it remains enabled by default in older versions [5].
                                            This protocol contains fundamental well-documented security vulnerabilities [6].

                                            Major browsers [7], including Safari [8], Firefox [9], Chrome [10] and Edge [11],
                                            now disable this protocol by default.

                                            Authorities like NIST (FIPS) [12], IETF [6] [9], NSA (National Security Agency) [12] [13],

                                            While disabling TLS 1.1 improves security, it may disrupt certain older applications that

                                    This script improves security by enforcing secure network connections across all .NET applications.

                                    By setting the `SchUseStrongCrypto` configuration [1] [2] [3] [4], it prevents the use of outdated
                                    and insecure connections, including:

                                    - Protocols weaker than TLS 1.1 [1] [4] and TLS 1.2 [1] [2] [4].
                                    - Cipher algorithms such as RC4 [4] [5], NULL [6], DES [6], and export suites [6].
                                    - Hash algorithms like MD5 [6].

                                    Authorities like Microsoft [1], and Department of Defense (DoD) [3]
                                    recommend this configuration as part of their security guidelines.

                                    This script applies to all .NET applications on the system [1].
                                    A ***.NET application*** is any software developed using Microsoft's .NET platform [7].
                                    This includes many third-party and system applications on Windows, like PowerShell [8].
                                    A .NET application can be various of types, ranging from mobile apps to cloud services [7].

                                    This script affects only the client-side (outgoing) connections of an application [1].
                                    It secures outgoing data from the application without changing how incoming data is handled.

                                    You must restart your system after running this script to activate the security improvements [2] [5].

                                    This script enables the DTLS 1.2 protocol.
                                    This protocol is identified as `DTLS 1.2` on Windows [1] [2].

                                    DTLS (*Datagram Transport Layer Security*) provides secure communication over the UDP protocol [3].
                                    Based on the TLS protocol, DTLS offers equivalent security measures [3].
                                    Common uses include online gaming, DNS lookups, and VPN services.

                                    Despite being superseded by the more secure DTLS 1.3 [4],
                                    DTLS 1.2 is still approved by authorities like NIST [5], NSA [6],
                                    and the German Federal Office for Information Security [2].

                                    DTLS 1.2 is based on TLS 1.2 [7].
                                    It's supported by Windows since Windows 10 version 1607 and by Windows Server 2016 Standard [8] [9].
                                    privacy.sexy chooses DTLS 1.2 over DTLS 1.3 due to the lack of support for DTLS 1.3 on Windows platforms [8].

                                    This script only works on Windows 10 version 1607 or newer.
                                    This restriction is in place to maintain system stability
                                    by allowing only supported Windows versions to use the protocol.

                                    This script provides secure connections for older .NET Framework applications.

                                    It enables the automatic adoption of newer, more secure protocols as supported by the operating system [1].
                                    If the operating system supports newer TLS versions, applications will automatically use these without
                                    any need for modifications to the application code or .NET Framework settings [1] [2] [3].
                                    For example, this configuration enables .NET Framework 3.5 applications, which do not natively support
                                    TLS 1.2, to adopt TLS 1.2 [2].

                                    This script applies to all .NET applications on the system [1].
                                    A ***.NET application*** is any software developed using Microsoft's .NET platform [4].
                                    This includes many third-party and system applications on Windows, like PowerShell [5].
                                    A .NET application can be various of types, ranging from mobile apps to cloud services [4].

                                    This script modifies the `SystemDefaultTlsVersions` configuration [1] [2] [3] [6] [7].
                                    This setting enables the operating system to automatically select the most secure available protocol for
                                    .NET applications [1].
                                    Thus, applications automatically benefit from future security enhancements and new protocols added to the
                                    operating system, without the need for updates [1].
                                    This maintains ongoing security as new TLS versions emerge and older ones are retired [1].
                                    It may also resolve compatibility issues with older devices or software [7].
                                    However, it may also result in compatibility issues if the system defaults are too restrictive [8].

                                    > **Caution:** This may cause compatibility issues with older devices or software.

                            This category improves security by disabling insecure remote administration features.
                            Organizations use remote administration tools to manage multiple systems from a central location,
                            performing tasks such as software updates, system checks, and configuration changes.

                            However, if not properly secured, unauthorized users could exploit these tools to access sensitive data
                            or control systems.
                            This category addresses such vulnerabilities by disabling outdated or insecure remote access methods,
                            thus securing systems against potential cyber threats.

                            While these measures maintain information confidentiality and integrity, they may restrict some remote
                            management functionalities.

                                    This script configures the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) client to disable **basic authentication** [1] [2].
                                    Basic authentication is a security protocol where a user provides a username and password in plain text for verification [3].
                                    It improves security by preventing the interception and misuse of plain text passwords [1].

                                    It achieves this by modifying the `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WinRM\Client!AllowBasic`
                                    registry key [1] [2].

                                    While WinRM clients do not use Basic authentication by default [2], this script ensures that this less
                                    secure method remains disabled.

                                    This script increases your system's security by preventing unauthorized users from seeing account names in the
                                    Security Accounts Manager (SAM) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6].
                                    The Security Accounts Manager (SAM) is a database in Windows that stores user account information and
                                    is critical for user authentication processes.
                                    When account names are exposed, attackers might use them for guessing passwords or tricking people into revealing
                                    sensitive information [4] [6] [7] [8].
                                    This is a security action recommended by organizations like the Department of Defense [1], NASA [2], IRS [8],
                                    NIST [6], CIS [4], and Microsoft [3].

                                    The change is enacted through the `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa!restrictanonymoussam` registry
                                    value [1] [2] [4] [5]. By default, it's enabled [4] and Windows restricts this setting if the registry value does
                                    not exist [3].

                                    While the script protects against these threats, it may also affect compatibility with older systems.
                                    It prevents trust with Windows NT 4.0 domains [4] [5] [7] [9] and causes issues for older systems such as Windows NT 3.51
                                    and Windows 95 when accessing server resources [4] [5] [7].
                                    Typically, anonymous connections are requested by earlier versions of clients (down-level clients) during SMB session setup [7].

                                    The script has no impact on domain controllers since their behavior in this aspect is controlled by different settings [5] [7].
                                    The policy setting does not require a restart to become effective [5], and there is no impact on current systems
                                    where the default behavior already includes this restriction [4].

                                    Despite the potential interoperability issues with older systems, the script maintains a security posture that is
                                    important in modern networks to minimize unauthorized access and protect user privacy.

                                    *Named Pipes* allow programs on a computer or network to communicate with each other.
                                    *Anonymous access* lets users connect to services without a username or password, increasing
                                    the risk of unauthorized access.

                                    This script improves your privacy and security by disabling Windows administrative shares,
                                    which are typically used for remote access to your computer's file system.

                                    Windows automatically creates hidden administrative shares, such as `C$` and `D$`, that allow system administrators remote access to
                                    every disk volume on your computer [1] [2]. These shares are often targeted as potential attack vectors [3].

                                    Disabling administrative shares is generally a good practice for enhancing security. It is recommended by various security standards
                                    and compliance frameworks, including some government standards [3], PCI-DSS [4], and CIS [2]. It reduces the system's vulnerability
                                    to unauthorized remote access.

                                    These shares are often used for system administrators to perform tasks like software installation and vulnerability scanning
                                    remotely [1]. Disabling them may limit remote management capabilities. This might require setting up network shares manually
                                    for specific folders or drives, which is more secure but requires additional effort.

                                    Some software, such as Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) [2], Microsoft Operations Manager [2], Microsoft PsTools [5],
                                    and certain third-party network backup applications [2], rely on administrative shares. Therefore, disabling these shares could
                                    disrupt their functionality.

                                    > **Caution:**
                                    > This may lead to reduced functionality or connectivity issues, particularly in enterprise environments where remote

                                    The Telnet Client enables remote server connections [1].
                                    It is inherently insecure because it transmits all data, including sensitive credentials,
                                    in clear text without encryption [2] [3].
                                    This lack of encryption makes it vulnerable to interception and misuse [3].
                                    Due to these security flaws, entities such as NIST [2], Department of Defense [2]
                                    and Microsoft [1] recommend removing or disabling this feature.

                                    Although this feature is disabled by default in newer versions of Windows [1], ensuring
                                    that it remains disabled can prevent accidental or unauthorized use.

                                    Windows Remote Assistance allows a third party to remotely access your PC [1].
                                    This capability, known as *Solicited Remote Assistance* [2], enables another user to view or take
                                    control of your computer [2] [3] [4] [5].

                                    Disabling Remote Assistance improves security by:

                                    - Preventing others from remotely viewing or controlling your computer [2].
                                    - Reducing the risk of exploitation from RDP-related vulnerabilities [5].
                                    - Reducing the attack surface by eliminating unnecessary remote access functionalities.

                                    The script modifies the following settings to achieve this:

                                    - It configures `fAllowToGetHelp` to block users from requesting remote assistance [3].
                                    - It configures `fAllowFullControl` to prevent remote users from gaining full control of the system [4].

                                    These changes are applied via:

                                    - The application setting in the Windows registry at `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Remote Assistance` [6].

                        docs: |-
                            This category focuses on disabling or removal of specific networking features.
                            These are generally considered unnecessary or less secure for most users.

                            Disabling these features contributes to a more secure and privacy-focused environment by
                            eliminating potential vulnerabilities and reducing the system's attack surface.
                            These features may utilize outdated protocols or lack robust encryption and
                            authentication methods, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks.
                            If these features are not essential for your daily operations, it is
                            advisable to disable them to enhance your system's security.

                            The scripts target specific networking tools and protocols, ideal for users who don't need these
                            features, thus streamlining the system and potentially improving performance.

                                    This script disables the "Net.TCP Port Sharing" feature.

                                    This feature is part of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) [1].

                                    This feature enables multiple WCF applications to share the same TCP port [1].
                                    It manages incoming connections and routes them to the appropriate application based on
                                    the destination address found in the message stream [1].

                                    This increases the system's attack surface [2]:

                                    - When applications share the same port, more applications are exposed to network traffic.
                                    - It runs under a system account with high permissions, making the system vulnerable to extensive
                                        access by attackers if compromised [2].
                                    - Poor application configuration can increase risk of serious damage if an application is compromised [1].
                                    - The security of the system depends significantly on how well each individual application handles security.

                                    It's disabled by default on Windows due to security concerns [1].

                                    SMB Direct improves file transfer speeds across networks by utilizing network adapters that are
                                    Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) capable [1].

                                    Although not inherently insecure [2], maintaining unnecessary software can increase the attack surface,
                                    especially if the underlying RDMA hardware has vulnerabilities.

                                    The TFTP Client supports file transfers using the *Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)*.
                                    TFTP protocol is insecure because it lacks authentication and encryption capabilities [1] [2] [3].
                                    This makes data transferred via TFTP vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering [2] [3].

                                    Although TFTP's simplicity can be advantageous in certain contexts, such as configuring network devices,
                                    its security risks generally outweigh these benefits.
                                    Disabling it helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized data access and simplifies system security management [1] [2].

                category: Disable clipboard data collection
                docs: |-
                    This category includes scripts that focus on disabling various aspects of clipboard data collection in Windows.
                    The clipboard is a critical component of the operating system, often containing sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, and other
                    personal information [1].
                    However, features such as clipboard history and device synchronization can significantly increase privacy and security risks.

                    By default, Windows tends to store clipboard data in an unencrypted format [2], making it easily accessible to malicious applications or scripts.
                    Additionally, data synchronization features can lead to sensitive information being stored on remote servers or shared across devices, increasing the
                    risk of data exposure.

                    The scripts in this category address these risks by disabling the related features..
                    While these features offer convenience and productivity benefits, they can inadvertently compromise user privacy and security.

                    > **Caution**: Applying these scripts may lead to a loss of certain functionalities. Users who rely on these features for their daily tasks should
                    > consider the trade-offs before proceeding with these changes.

                        docs: |-
                            This script disables the Cloud Clipboard feature [1], also known as the cross-device clipboard [2].
                            The Cloud Clipboard, introduced in the Windows 10 October 2018 Update [3], synchronizes clipboard contents across Windows
                            devices [1] [2] [4]. While this feature enhances usability, it can pose a privacy risk as sensitive information like passwords or credit card
                            details [5] might be inadvertently synchronized and stored on Microsoft servers.

                            Disabling Cloud Clipboard is recommended in secure environments where clipboard data should remain local to the system, avoiding
                            potential exposure or misuse of sensitive information [6]. The Center for Internet Security (CIS) recommends disabling this feature in
                            such settings for enhanced security [6]. Moreover, Microsoft acknowledges that disabling network connections linked to the Cloud Clipboard
                            can improve privacy [1]. This script secures your clipboard data by preventing unauthorized access from other processes on your computer
                            or network, reducing the risk of data theft.

                            The script configures the following registry keys:

                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System!AllowCrossDeviceClipboard`: Disables the Cloud Clipboard feature, preventing
                            clipboard synchronization across devices [1] [2] [6].
                            - `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Clipboard!CloudClipboardAutomaticUpload`: Stops the automatic upload of clipboard data to the cloud [7].

                            > **Caution**: After running this script, clipboard contents will not synchronize across devices [1] [2] [6].
                            > Text or images copied on one device will not be accessible on other devices [3] [4] [5].
                            > This enhances privacy and security but limits the clipboard's functionality across your Windows devices.

                        docs: |-
                            This script deactivates the clipboard history feature in Windows, a feature that is enabled by default [1] [2].
                            Regularly, users copy sensitive data such as usernames and passwords to their clipboard, making clipboard history
                            valuable to attackers for gathering information for post-exploitation activities like lateral movement.

                            Microsoft introduced clipboard history in the Windows 10 October 2018 Update [1], offering enhanced functionality, including
                            multi-device sync and customizable history management [1].
                            Despite these benefits, clipboard history poses several security risks:

                            - **Plain Text Storage**: Clipboard data is stored unencrypted, making it vulnerable to access by malicious applications [3].
                            - **Persistent Memory**: The data remains in memory until overwritten or the machine restarts, exposing it to unauthorized access
                            by other users or malware [3].
                            - **Process Accessibility**: Most running processes and applications can access clipboard data, increasing the risk if any are malicious [3].
                            - **Open Network Threats**: Malicious website scripts could potentially access clipboard data, leading to data theft [3].
                            - **Windows Clipboard History**: Stores the last 25 copied text and image items, which could include sensitive information [3].
                            - **Increased Attack Surface**: Clipboard history is susceptible to exploitation by malware that silently accesses and logs clipboard data [3].

                            Microsoft's privacy statement also indicates that clipboard data could be used for marketing and advertising purposes [4].

                            Given these risks, especially when handling sensitive data like passwords or credit card numbers [5], it is advisable for
                            users concerned about security to disable clipboard history to safeguard their privacy.

                            This script modifies Windows Registry keys to turn off clipboard history and sync features:

                            - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Clipboard!EnableClipboardHistory`: Disables the local clipboard history for the current user [6] [7] [8].
                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System!AllowClipboardHistory`: Disables the policy for storing clipboard contents [2] [9].

                            This service is responsible for clipboard history and synchronization across devices [1].

                            Microsoft acknowledges that disabling this service does not adversely affect the system's core functionality [2].

                            Disabling this service enhances your security by reducing your system's
                            vulnerability surface. This service has been historically susceptible to vulnerabilities such as Privilege Escalation vulnerability [3].
                            Turning off `cbdhsvc` also helps improve system performance by reducing the number of background processes as `cbdhsvc` runs automatically
                            in the background [1].
                            Additionally, it enhances privacy by preventing the storage and sharing of clipboard history with Microsoft servers.
                            Clipboard data often contains sensitive information, including passwords and credit card numbers [4].
                            
                            > **Caution**: Disabling this service will remove the functionalities for clipboard history and synchronization across devices.
                            > If you depend on these features, you should weigh the benefits against the loss of these functionalities.

        category: Block tracking hosts
        docs: |-
            This category includes scripts that enhance privacy by blocking communications with hosts known for tracking
            and data collection.

            A **host** is a domain name serving as an address for a computer or resource on the Internet.
            These hosts are often used by software applications, operating systems, and services to collect data, which
            can include personal information, usage patterns, and more.

            By modifying the **hosts file** (a simple text file on your computer that maps domain names to IP addresses),
            these scripts stop your computer from connecting to servers that collect user data.

            This not only reduces personal data sent to companies and third-party trackers, enhancing privacy, but may also
            optimize system performance by minimizing unnecessary network requests.

            > **Caution**: These scripts may interfere with the functionality of apps or services relying on the blocked data.
            > Balance privacy with functionality according to your preferences and needs.

                docs: |-
                    This script prevents Windows from sending crash reports to Microsoft, enhancing your privacy.

                    Windows Error Reporting (WER) creates minidumps (small memory snapshots at crash time) and
                    sends them to Microsoft [1].
                    
                    Although intended to improve software by analyzing crash data, this feature raises privacy concerns
                    such as:

                    - Inclusion of sensitive information within the dumps, such as personal data and passwords [2] [3].
                    - Data sharing with Microsoft and other third parties through the Windows Desktop Application Program [1].

                    To safeguard your privacy, this script blocks specific hosts that Windows uses to transmit crash data,
                    ensuring these minidump files remain on your local machine and are not sent to Microsoft or its partners.

                    The blocked hosts are:

                    This script improves privacy by blocking data sharing to the *Windows Connected User Experiences and

                    This component is responsible for collecting and transmitting diagnostic data and usage

                    These endpoints play a crucial role in remotely configuring diagnostics-related settings and data collection [3].
                    For instance, they allow for the remote blocking of events being sent back to Microsoft or enrolling a device

                            Dropbox collects data such as:

                            - **Account Information**: Includes your name, email, phone number, payment details, and address shared during account

                            Spotify, known for being pre-installed with Windows [2], can collect data in the background without user consent.

                            This script stops the transmission of real-time data to the Spotify Live Tile [1], which may contain user-specific content or usage patterns.

                            **Live Tiles**, a feature within UWP apps, automatically collect and display updated information
                            directly on the Start menu, without opening the app [3].
                            The Live Tiles feature, once available on Windows 8.1 and 10 [4], has been replaced by the
                            **Widgets** feature in Windows 11 [5].

                            > **Caution**: Using this script may have side effects on Spotify functionalities beyond the Live Tile, potentially influencing other app

                    to provide location-based services.

                    However, the collection of such data raises privacy concerns as it involves transmitting potentially sensitive information

                    Sending this data to Microsoft allows for detailed profiling of your location and movements [6].

                    This script blocks the connection between Microsoft Edge and the Experimentation and Configuration Service (ECS) [1].

                    ECS delivers various updates to Microsoft Edge, including configurations, feature rollouts, and experiments [1]:

                    - **Configurations** aim to ensure the product's health, security, and privacy compliance [1].
                      These settings are uniform for all users, based on their platforms and channels, and can enable or disable features
                      as necessary [1].
                    - **Controlled Feature Rollout (CFR)** gradually introduces a new feature to a portion of the user base [1].
                    - **Experiments** test new features and functionalities within Microsoft Edge that are still under development [1].
                      These features are not visible to all users and are activated or deactivated through experiment flags [1].

                    By blocking communication with ECS, this script prevents Microsoft Edge from receiving updates related to these payloads [1].
                    It enhances user privacy by limiting exposure to experimental features and configurations that may collect data or alter
                    the browsing experience without the user's explicit consent.

                    Although designed to protect you, its features may compromise your privacy and decrease computer performance.

                    Privacy concerns include:

                    - Sending personal data to Microsoft for analysis [1] [2] [9].
                      This allows Microsoft to collect and potentially access your sensitive information.

                      This prevents users from controlling what data Microsoft collects about them.
                    - Incorrectly identifying privacy-enhancing scripts from privacy.sexy as malicious software [4].
                      This discourages users from using tools designed to protect their privacy.
                    - Defender itself may introduce vulnerabilities [11] [12].
                      This can potentially allow attackers to exploit Defender's own features or implementation flaws.
                      Despite being a security product, it increases your system's attack surface.

                    Turning off Defender also improves your computer's speed by freeing up system resources [5].

                    However, disabling these features may result in:

                    - Potential program malfunctions [13], as these security features are integral to Windows [6].
                    - Lowered defenses against malware and other online threats.

                    These scripts mainly target the built-in Defender features.
                    Most Defender services that come with Microsoft 365 subscriptions remain largely unaffected [7] [8].
                    However, the scripts may impact additional Defender products not included in the standard Windows
                    installation, such as **Defender for Endpoint**.

                        docs: |-
                            This category features scripts designed to reduce or eliminate data collection by Defender.

                            Disabling these features enhances privacy by limiting the information shared with Microsoft.

                            Although Microsoft Defender offers security benefits, it also collects data for analysis,
                            service improvement, and threat detection.
                            However, this data collection may raise privacy concerns for users.
                            The scripts in this category allow you to:

                            1. Minimize the data sent to Microsoft about your system and Defender usage.
                            2. Reduce potential exposure of your files and system information.
                            3. Limit Microsoft's ability to track your security-related activities.

                            Potential impacts of disabling data collection:

                            1. Reduce Microsoft's ability to detect new threats quickly
                            2. Limit the effectiveness of cloud-based protection features
                            3. Potentially impact Microsoft's ability to improve Defender based on real-world data

                            > **Caution**: This change enhances privacy but may reduce overall system security.

                                docs: |-
                                    This category contains scripts that disable or limit Microsoft Defender's cloud-based protection features.

                                    Microsoft Defender's cloud protection is also known as Microsoft MAPS (Microsoft Active Protection Service) [1] [2] [3]
                                    or Microsoft SpyNet [2] [3].
                                    It is an online community that helps detect and prevent the spread of malware [3].

                                    These features automatically collect data and send it to Microsoft [3].
                                    They leverage user data to identify potentially malicious programs, sharing details such as file information, IP address,
                                    computer identification, and system/browser information [1] [3].
                                    The collected data may include sensitive personal information [3].

                                    The scripts in this category aim to:

                                    1. Reduce the amount of data sent to Microsoft about your system and Defender usage.
                                    2. Limit potential exposure of your files and system information.
                                    3. Decrease Microsoft's ability to track your security-related activities.

                                    Disabling these cloud protection features may:

                                    - Enhance privacy by limiting data shared with Microsoft.
                                    - Improve system performance by reducing background data collection and transmission.
                                    - Increase control over what runs on your device.

                                    However, it's important to note that these changes may also:

                                    - Reduce Defender's ability to detect new or complex threats quickly.
                                    - Limit the effectiveness of real-time protection updates.
                                    - Impact Microsoft's ability to improve Defender based on real-world data.

                                    These scripts are recommended for users who prioritize privacy over potential security benefits
                                    from Microsoft's cloud-based analysis.

                                            This script disables the "Block at first sight".

                                            Block at first sight is **Defender Antivirus** feature [1] [2] [3] [4].
                                            It protects against threats by quickly detecting and blocking new malware [1].
                                            When Defender Antivirus encounters a suspicious file it can't identify, it consults its cloud protection backend [1].
                                            The cloud backend uses heuristics, machine learning, and automated analysis to identify malicious files [1].
                                            This back-end is part of **Cloud Protection** [1].
                                            It is also known as **Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS)** [1] [2] [3] or **SpyNet** [2].

                                            This feature is enabled by default [4], depending on other configurations [1] [2].
                                            The feature is included in **Defender for Endpoint** suite [1].

                                            Automatically sending files to Microsoft's cloud [1] [3] raises significant privacy concerns.
                                            This script improves your privacy by preventing automatic file uploads to Microsoft.
                                            It may also improve system performance by reducing background network activity.

                                            However, disabling this feature may reduce your device and network protection levels [1] [3].
                                            The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) recommends keeping this feature enabled for additional security [3].

                                            > **Caution**: This change enhances privacy but may reduce overall system security.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            This script configures the option by:

                                            - Using the Defender CLI to set the `DisableBlockAtFirstSeen` preference [4].
                                            - Configuring `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows Defender\SpyNet!DisableBlockAtFirstSeen` to mimic the CLI.
                                              Tests indicate that the CLI sets this registry key.
                                            - Setting the registry key `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\SpyNet!DisableBlockAtFirstSeen`
                                              to configure the group policy [2] [3].

                                            This script disables the extended cloud check feature in Defender Antivirus by reducing its timeout.

                                            The extended cloud check is a Defender Antivirus feature [1] [2] [3] [4].
                                            It allows Defender to block a suspicious file for up to 60 seconds while it is
                                            scanned in the cloud to verify its safety [1] [2].
                                            This script reduces the extended cloud check timeout to 0, effectively disabling the feature.
                                            This maintains the standard (default) time, which is 10 seconds [1] [2] [3].

                                            This feature is part of Microsoft MAPS [1] [2], also known as SpyNet [4] or
                                            Microsoft Active Protection Service [4].
                                            It sends your data, including personal information, to Microsoft [4].

                                            Disabling this feature enhances privacy by limiting the amount of data sent to Microsoft's cloud for analysis.
                                            may also improve system performance by reducing the waiting time for cloud-based file analysis.

                                            However, this change comes with a security trade-off.
                                            Disabling the extended cloud check may reduce Defender's ability to detect and block new or complex malware
                                            requiring thorough cloud-based analysis.

                                            > **Caution**: This change enhances privacy but may reduce overall system security.

                                            This script configures the settings by:

                                            - Using the Defender CLI to set the `CloudExtendedTimeout` preference [3].
                                            - Configuring `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\MpEngine!MpBafsExtendedTimeout` to mimic the CLI.
                                              Tests show that the CLI sets this registry key.
                                            - Setting the registry key `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\MpEngine!MpBafsExtendedTimeout`
                                              to configure the group policy [1].

                                            This script disables the aggressive cloud protection setting in Microsoft Defender Antivirus.

                                            **Cloud protection** delivers faster protection to devices compared to traditional
                                            security intelligence updates [4].
                                            It works on different aggressiveness levels in blocking and scanning suspicious files [1] [3].
                                            This feature applies to both **Microsoft Defender Antivirus** [1] [2] [3] [4]
                                            and **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** [4].

                                            By default, the protection level is unconfigured [1] [3] [4].
                                            This default state provides the least protection [4].
                                            This script explicitly configures the setting to ensure aggressive options are disabled.

                                            Disabling this feature:

                                            - Enhances privacy by limiting *cloud protection*, which sends personal data to Microsoft [5].
                                            - Increases user control over what runs on their device [4].
                                            - May improve system performance by optimizing scan performance [4].

                                            > **Caution**: This change enhances privacy but may reduce overall system security.

                                            This script disables notifications that can turn off security intelligence in Microsoft Defender.

                                            This script prevents the antimalware service from receiving notifications to disable individual
                                            security intelligence [1] [2] [3].
                                            *Security intelligence* is updated information that helps antivirus software detect and protect against
                                            the latest threats, working with cloud-based protection [4].
                                            The *antimalware service*, also known as Microsoft Defender Antivirus, is essential to
                                            both Microsoft Defender and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint [5].

                                            By default, Microsoft uses these notifications to disable security intelligence that may cause false

                                            This functionality is provided by Microsoft MAPS (Microsoft Active Protection Service) [1] [2] [3].
                                            MAPS was previously known as Microsoft SpyNet [3] and is recently referred to as Cloud Protection [6].
                                            It operates by collecting potentially sensitive personal data [6].

                                            Disabling these notifications limits Cloud Protection functionality, which inherently shares data with
                                            Microsoft [6].
                                            You also maintain more control over your system's security settings.
                                            However, this may reduce the accuracy of threat detection, possibly leading to more false positives.

                                            This script primarily configures Defender Antivirus [1] [4] [5] [6].
                                            It also applies to other Microsoft antimalware solutions such as: Microsoft Security Essentials [4],
                                            older Windows Defender [4], Microsoft Diagnostics and Recovery Toolset (DaRT) [4], System Center
                                            Configuration Manager [4], System Center Endpoint Protection [4] and Windows Intune [4].

                                            This script disables Microsoft Defender's cloud protection reporting.

                                            **Cloud protection** is was previously also known as
                                            *Microsoft MAPS (Microsoft Active Protection Service)* [1] [2] [3].
                                            It was previously known as *Windows Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service* [3] and
                                            *Microsoft Defender Antivirus Cloud Protection Service* [3].
                                            It's a feature of **Defender Antivirus** [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].

                                            This feature creates an online community that helps users address potential threats and
                                            prevent new malicious software [1] [2] [3] [6] [7].
                                            Participation in the community is often called *SpyNet membership* [8] [9]
                                            or simply *membership* [1] [2] [6].

                                            When Defender detects unclassified software or changes, it shows how other members responded to
                                            the alert [9].
                                            Your participation helps Microsoft and others investigate potential threats [9].

                                            Cloud protection automatically collects and sends information about software, user behavior,
                                            and system data [1] [2] [3].
                                            In some cases, it may transmit sensitive personal information to Microsoft [1] [2] [3].

                                            This feature is off by default on most systems [1] [2] [3] [6] [9].
                                            However, it may come enabled on some editions, like Windows on Azure.

                                            Disabling cloud protection:

                                            - Enhances privacy by preventing the automatic sharing of potentially sensitive
                                              data with Microsoft.
                                              While DISA initially recommended disabling cloud protection [8], they later encouraged enabling it
                                              for additional security [4].
                                              However, CIS continues to recommend deactivation in high-security settings for enhanced privacy [3].
                                              This script prioritizes privacy by disabling the feature.
                                            - May improve system performance by reducing background data collection and
                                              transmission.
                                            - May reduce protection against new threats by limiting Defender's access to community insights and
                                              real-time updates.

                                            > **Caution**: This change enhances privacy but may reduce overall system security.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            This script configures the following settings:

                                            - Using the Defender CLI to set the `MAPSReporting` preference [6] [7].
                                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Spynet!SpynetReporting`
                                              to configure the Group Policy (GPO) setting [1] [2] [3] [8] [9].
                                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Spynet!LocalSettingOverrideSpynetReporting`
                                              to consistently apply the desired Group Policy (GPO) setting [3] [5].
                                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Spynet!SpynetReporting`:
                                              This registry key is undocumented but present in recent versions of Windows.
                                              Tests show that changing this value via the CLI also alters the registry value.

                                            This script disables Defender's automatic submission of file samples to Microsoft for analysis.

                                            Automatic file submission is a feature of **Defender Antivirus** [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6].
                                            By default, Defender automatically sends 'safe' file samples to Microsoft for analysis [1] [2].

                                            This action is part of **Microsoft's Advanced Protection Service (MAPS)** [1] [2].
                                            Previously, this service was known as **Microsoft SpyNet** [1] [2].
                                            It is now referred to as **cloud protection** [3].

                                            This automatic collection and submission can include your personal information [3].

                                            This script sets the sample submission setting to "Never send" (value `2`), preventing any automatic
                                            file submissions [1] [2] [4] [5].
                                            This enhances privacy by stopping the automatic sharing of potentially sensitive file data with Microsoft.
                                            It also improves system performance by reducing background data transfers.

                                            However, this change may reduce Defender's ability to detect new threats, as it relies
                                            on sample submissions to improve its detection capabilities.
                                            The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) recommends against disabling sample submission [3].

                                            > **Caution**: This change enhances privacy but may reduce overall system security.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            This script configures the following settings:

                                            - Using the Defender CLI to set the `SubmitSamplesConsent` preference [3] [4].
                                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Spynet!SubmitSamplesConsent`
                                              to configure the Group Policy (GPO) setting [1] [2].
                                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Spynet!SubmitSamplesConsent` [7].
                                              It has enabled value of `1` in recent versions of Windows [7].
                                              Tests show that changing this value via the CLI also alters the registry value.

                                            This script disables the real-time security intelligence updates in Defender.

                                            Real-time security intelligence updates are a feature of **Defender Antivirus** [1].
                                            They are part of **Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS)** [1] [2].
                                            MAPS is also known as *Microsoft SpyNet* or *cloud protection* [3].
                                            This service collects and sends personal data and other information to Microsoft [3].

                                            When enabled, if Defender encounters an unknown file and MAPS has new intelligence on a threat involving that file,
                                            it immediately receives the latest security updates [1] [2].
                                            By default, these updates are enabled [1] [2].
                                            This script disables them.

                                            Disabling this feature may enhance your privacy by reducing data sent to Microsoft.
                                            It may also slightly improve system performance by reducing background network activity and processing.
                                            However, this change may reduce your system's security by delaying the receipt of new threat
                                            information.
                                            Defender will still receive regular updates, but not in real-time.

                                    This script prevents Microsoft's Malicious Software Reporting Tool (MSRT) from transmitting diagnostic data.

                                    **Malicious Software Reporting Tool** is a component of the **Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT)** [1].
                                    The MSRT is designed to detect and remove specific, prevalent malware from Windows computers [2].
                                    The tool is integrated into **Defender Antivirus** [3].
                                    It's also downloaded and run automatically by Windows Update in the background [2].

                                    This tool raises significant privacy concerns:

                                    - It continuously sends data to Microsoft [3].
                                    - Microsoft is reported to share the data from this tool with government agencies, including police,
                                      to track citizens [1] [2] [4].
                                    - Since August 2016 (version 5.39), the tool sends a **Heartbeat Report** to Microsoft each time it runs,
                                      even when the Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) is turned off [5].
                                      A *heartbeat report* is a small packet of data sent regularly to inform Microsoft that the tool is
                                      active and functioning.

                                    Disabling the diagnostic data transmission affects:

                                    - **Privacy:**
                                      Enhances user privacy by preventing Microsoft from collecting and sharing data from MSRT.
                                    - **System Performance:**
                                      May slightly improve system performance by reducing background network activity.
                                    - **Security:**
                                      May slightly reduce Microsoft's ability to track and respond to malware threats.
                                      However, the core antivirus functionality stays intact.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    This reporting occurs even when the `DiagTrack` service is disabled [5].

                                    Users can verify the MSRT's reporting behavior by examining the log file at `%SYSTEMROOT%\debug\mrt.log` [5].

                                    This script configures `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\MRT!DontReportInfectionInformation` registry key
                                    to halt this data sharing with Microsoft [3] [5] [6].

                                    This script prevents Defender from sending Watson events to Microsoft.

                                    Watson events are automatically sent reports to Microsoft when a program or service crashes or fails [1].
                                    By default, these reports are sent automatically [1] [2] [3].
                                    This script specifically targets reporting behavior of **Defender Antivirus** [3] without affecting
                                    other applications or services that may use Watson events.

                                    Disabling Watson events enhances privacy by preventing the automatic submission
                                    of potentially sensitive information about system crashes and failures [1].
                                    This practice is recommended by the Center for Internet Security (CIS) for additional privacy
                                    and security [1].

                                    After running this script, Microsoft will no longer receive automatic Watson event reports [1] [2] [3].
                                    This change improves privacy but may limit Microsoft's ability to diagnose and fix system issues.

                                    This script modifies the following registry keys:

                                    This script disables telemetry collection by Defender, enhancing user privacy.

                                    By default, Microsoft collects telemetry data from Microsoft Defender Antivirus and other
                                    Defender software [1].
                                    This data collection is referred to as 1DS telemetry [1].
                                    Microsoft's One Data Strategy (1DS) centralizes and collects telemetry from various
                                    Microsoft services and tools [2].
                                    The strategy collects data from various Microsoft services and tools [2].
                                    The Microsoft Defender Core Service collects telemetry for Microsoft Defender Antivirus and
                                    Microsoft Defender for Endpoint [1].

                                    Disabling telemetry enhances privacy by reducing the data sent to Microsoft about your
                                    system and Defender usage.
                                    It may also boost performance by reducing resource usage for telemetry collection.
                                    However, this action may limit Microsoft's ability to improve its antivirus service and address
                                    issues using user data [1].

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    It enhances privacy by limiting the data Microsoft collects about your system and usage habits.
                                    It may improve system performance by reducing background processes related to these features.
                                    Disabling this feature may affect Microsoft's ability to improve the Defender product [1].

                                    This script specifically targets the Microsoft Defender Core Service.
                                    This service is a part of **Defender Antivirus** and **Defender for Endpoint** products [2].
                                    It contributes to the stability and performance of these products [2].
                                    
                                    This service connects to Microsoft servers to receive remote configurations, manage feature rollouts,
                                    and participate in experiments [1].

                                    Disabling these features prevents:

                                    - **Remote configurations:** Settings such as feature flags configured by Microsoft on your computer [1].
                                    - **Controlled feature rollouts:** Gradual introduction of new features to subsets of users [1].
                                    - **Experiments:** Trials of experimental features.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    This script configures:

                                      registry key to set the Group Policy Object (GPO) [2].
                                    - `DisableCoreService1DSTelemetry` preference using the Defender CLI [2].
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\CoreService!DisableCoreServiceECSIntegration` registry key
                                      to control this feature. While this registry key is present by default in recent versions of Windows,

                                    This script disables the Azure data collection library by removing `MpAzSubmit.dll`

                                    Microsoft refers to this library as the **MpAzSubmit Module** [1] [2] and **Microsoft Malware Protection** [2].

                                    This file is responsible for:

                                    - Sending data to Azure storage [3]
                                    - HTTP communications and REST APIs [3]
                                    - It logs events and errors [3]

                                    This script enhances privacy by preventing **Defender Antivirus** from sending potentially sensitive data to Microsoft's cloud services.
                                    It may also slightly improve boot performance by reducing the components loaded during startup.

                                    However, this action may reduce system security.
                                    **Defender Antivirus** uses this module to submit suspicious files for analysis, enhancing its threat detection.
                                    Disabling it may make your system more vulnerable to new or emerging threats.

                                    > **Caution:**
                                    > This action impacts **Defender Antivirus** functionality and may make your system more vulnerable to malware.

                        category: Disable system modification restrictions
                        docs: |-
                            This category disables features that restrict system modifications in Windows.

                            This enables deeper system modifications, enhancing privacy by allowing the removal or disabling
                            of data-collecting components like **Defender**.

                            These features raise several concerns:

                            - Less user control:
                              - Users can't fully control what software runs on their own machines.
                              - It moves security control from device owners to hardware manufacturers and software vendors.
                            - Vendor lock-in:
                              - It restricts the ability to use, develop, and distribute third-party or open source software [1].
                              - DRM can be enforced at the hardware level [1].
                            - Privacy:
                              - These systems can uniquely identify hardware [2].
                              - They can enable detailed tracking of user activities.
                              - Remote attestation features may expose user behavior to third parties [3].

                            Disabling these restrictions provides several privacy benefits:

                            - Prevents system monitoring and data collection
                            - Stops sharing of system integrity data with Microsoft
                            - Allows modification of protected system components
                            - Enables deeper privacy customizations that are normally restricted

                            The scripts in this category may also improve system performance by:

                            - Reducing background monitoring processes
                            - Removing security checks during boot and operation
                            - Eliminating virtualization overhead
                            - Decreasing system resource usage

                            Potential security trade-offs:

                            - May make the system more vulnerable to malware
                            - May reduce protection against unauthorized system changes
                            - May weaken defenses against kernel-level attacks
                            - May allow tampering with security features

                            > **Caution:** This action may reduce security and can expose your system to potential threats

                                        - **Dev Drive** (storage volumes used for development) [18]
                                    - Collects and reports telemetry on system activity [11]
                                    - Enables communication between Defender components [11] [12] [19] such as `MsMpEng.exe` [13] [15] [19]
                                    - Provides security features such as:
                                        - **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** capabilities [6], sending telemetry [20]
                                        - **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** [11] to prevent unauthorized data sharing
                                        - **Tamper Protection** to restrict system modifications [16]
                                        - **Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS)** [14]

                                    This script enhances privacy by:

                                    - Stopping continuous system monitoring by Windows Defender
                                    - Blocking the collection of system activity data
                                    - Reducing telemetry sent to Microsoft
                                    - Limiting surveillance capabilities
                                    - Allowing deeper privacy configurations, including disabling Defender

                                    This script disables the Windows Defender boot driver (`WdBoot`) to reduce system monitoring and enhance your
                                    privacy and control.

                                    This driver is also known as:

                                    - Windows Defender Boot Driver [1]
                                    - Microsoft Defender Antivirus Boot Driver [2]
                                    - Early Launch Anti-malware (ELAM) boot driver [3]
                                    - Windows Defender ELAM Driver [4] [5]
                                    - Microsoft antimalware boot driver [6]
                                    - Early Launch Antimalware (ELAM) driver [7]

                                    Microsoft introduced this driver as a security feature in Windows 8 [4].
                                    As a default component in Windows, the driver comes pre-installed with the operating system [1] [2] [5].
                                    The driver serves as an integral part of both **Defender Antivirus** [5] [7] [8] [9] [10] and **Defender for Endpoint** [7] [8] [9].
                                    It functions as a component of Microsoft's anti-tampering mechanism that supports third-party security products [11].

                                    This driver starts before any other boot-start drivers begin running [7] [11] [12].
                                    It can also become operational through **Limited Periodic Scanning** [13].
                                    Once active, it assists the Windows kernel in determining whether other drivers are safe to run [7].

                                    The driver supports **Early Launch Anti-malware (ELAM)** [5].
                                    **ELAM** is a feature that allows antimalware software to start before other third-party components [12].
                                    ELAM can load an anti-malware driver before other non-Microsoft boot drivers and applications [5].
                                    It protects the system by helping to preserve the chain of trust established by **Secure Boot** and **Trusted Boot** [5].
                                    ELAM works as follows:

                                    - Antimalware drivers load first and can block unknown drivers from starting [12]
                                    - ELAM examines every boot driver to check if it's on the list of trusted drivers [5]
                                    - If a driver is not trusted, Windows will not load it [5]
                                    - After boot drivers start and storage becomes available, antimalware software continues blocking malware [12]

                                    The driver monitors the Windows boot process by:

                                    - Checking other drivers before they can start during Windows boot [4] [5] [7] [14]
                                    - Verifying driver certificates and hashes against its database [3] [4] [11] [14]
                                    - Managing a malware signature database [3] [12] [14]
                                    - Monitoring and rolling back changes to Defender's main driver (`WdFilter.sys`) as temper protection [3] [4] [5] [11]
                                    - Storing information for later analysis [4] [14]
                                    - Notifying other components [3] [4] [5] like `WdFilter.sys` [3] [4]

                                    This script improves privacy by:

                                    - Reduces system monitoring during boot
                                    - Allows deeper system modifications [5] to increase privacy such as disabling Defender
                                    - Prevents Microsoft from controlling which processes can run with antimalware protection [11]

                                    This script may improve system performance by:

                                    - Improving boot time by removing additional verification steps
                                    - Preventing system crashes (Blue Screen of Death) associated with this driver [15]

                                    However, this script may reduce security in the following ways:

                                    - Reducing protection against malicious boot drivers [5]
                                    - Removing early-boot malware detection [11] [12] [14]
                                    - Creating an unsupported system configuration [8] [9] that may cause stability issues [16]

                                    > **Caution:**
                                    > Disabling this feature removes security checks during system startup, which could may malicious software to run during boot.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    This driver installs as part of the `Windows-Defender-Drivers` package [17].

                                    This script:

                                    - Disables the `wdboot` service [1] [2] [8] [9]
                                    - Removes driver files from:
                                        - `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\drivers\WdBoot.sys` [1] [2] [3] [6] [10] [14] [18]
                                        - `C:\Windows\ELAMBKUP\WdBoot.sys` [7]
                                    - Removes registry configuration at `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\EarlyLaunch!BackupPath` [7]
                                    - Deletes signature database at `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\Config\elam` [14]

                                    On older systems, this driver file may be found at `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\drivers\wd\WdBoot.sys` [15] [18]

                                docs: |-
                                    This script disables the Microsoft Security Events filter driver (`MsSecFlt.sys`).

                                    This driver is known by different names:

                                    - Microsoft Security Events Component File System Filter Driver [1] [2]
                                    - MSSense: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for EDR Sensor [3]
                                    - Microsoft Security Eve Kernel [4]
                                    - Microsoft Security Events Component Minifilter [5] [6] [7]
                                    - Microsoft Security Events Component Minifilter driver [8]
                                    - `MsSecFlt` [5] [6] [9].

                                    It is a **minifilter** that inspects the file system [1].
                                    **Minifilter** is also known as **file system filter driver** [10].
                                    It targets a file system or another file system filter driver [10].
                                    A minifilter intercepts requests before they reach their target, modifying or extending functionality [10].

                                    It is used by Windows to monitor security-related events [2].
                                    It monitors the following activities:

                                    - File system operations [1] [11] [12]
                                    - Process activities [1] [11] [13] [14]
                                    - Registry changes [1] [12]
                                    - Network interactions [1]
                                    - Kernel structure and components [13] [14]

                                    It protects these components from tampering and detects unauthorized modifications [13] [14].
                                    It performs continuous integrity checks on system components [1] [13] [14].
                                    It detects and responds to tampering or corruption of kernel components [13] [14]

                                    This component exposes system data.
                                    It logs events using **Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)** [1] [2].
                                    These logs provide security data for other Microsoft and third-party tools [2].
                                    It additionally provides kernel telemetry data [15].

                                    It's a core **Defender** component [1] [7] [16] [17] [18].
                                    It comes as part of:

                                    - **Defender for Endpoint** suite [1] [3] [19] (formerly **Windows Advanced Threat Protection** [20] [21] [22]).
                                    - **Defender Antivirus** [23].
                                    - **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)** system [11] [19], which monitors and responds to potential security threats.
                                    - **Dev Drive** [3].
                                      It's used when using **Let antivirus filters protect Dev Drives** option is neabled [24].
                                      **Dev Drive** is a proprietary storage volume designed to enhance performance for developer workloads on Windows [3].
                                    - **Microsoft Purview** for **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** functionality [12].

                                    By disabling this driver, you may enhance your privacy by preventing the collection and logging
                                    of detailed security events related to your system's activities.
                                    Reducing kernel telemetry helps protect your system data.
                                    Disabling this protection enables deeper system modifications, potentially enhancing privacy.
                                    These modifications may include disabling data-collecting components like **Defender** or enabling additional
                                    privacy features that are otherwise restricted.

                                    Disabling the driver may improve system performance by preventing it from loading at startup and reducing monitoring overhead.

                                    However, disabling this driver can reduce your system's security.
                                    It may expose your system to malware, unauthorized changes, and attacks like **DLL hijacking** [25].

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > Disabling this driver may limit your system's ability to detect and respond to security threats,
                                    > increasing vulnerability to malware, unauthorized access, and other risks.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    This script performs the following actions:

                                    - Disables the `MsSecFlt` service [5] [6] [9].
                                    - Removes the driver file located at `%SYSTEMROOT%\system32\drivers\MsSecFlt.sys` [5] [6] [9] [16].
                                    - Removes the associated library file at `%SYSTEMROOT%\system32\mssecuser.dll` [9] [22] [26].

                                    `mssecuser.dll` is also known as **Microsoft Security Events Component Library** [12] [26].
                                    Its functions include:

                                    - Providing a user-space library to the driver [9].
                                    - Communicating with the kernel-level driver (`MsSecFlt`) [12].
                                    - Monitoring and filtering file and registry activities, helping with code integrity features [12].

                                    These components are installed by `Windows-SECDriver` package [9].

                                docs: |-
                                    This script disables the **Microsoft Security Core Boot Driver** (`msseccore.sys`).

                                    This driver is a kernel-mode component that enforces security policies during the boot process [1] [2].
                                    It was introduced in Windows 11 22H2, starting with Insider Preview Build 25188 [2] [3] [4].
                                    It operates as a **Secure Boot** driver [4].
                                    **Secure Boot** is a feature that prevents unauthorized software from loading at startup and requires compatible hardware [5].

                                    The driver handles several security-related tasks:

                                    - Conducts boot-time security checks [1] [2].
                                      A malfunction may cause **blue screen of death (BSOD)** with the stop code
                                      `MSSECCORE_ASSERTION_FAILURE`, blocking proper Windows boot [2] [4].
                                    - Verifies code integrity and digital signatures [1] [2].
                                      It checks system processes and files to prevent tampering [1].
                                      It enforces security policies by suspending processes that violate them and controlling file system operations [1].
                                    - Protects critical memory regions [1].
                                    - Interacts with other security components such as the **Kernel Shim Engine** for security enhancements [1].
                                    - Provides notifications of security-relevant system events [1],
                                      delivering these to other security tools [6].

                                    Disabling this driver may enhance privacy by allowing system modifications that are otherwise restricted.
                                    Some privacy improvements require changes to system files or integrity checks enforced by this driver.

                                    The script may also improve boot speed by bypassing these security checks.

                                    However, this comes with a trade-off:

                                    - Disabling the driver may lower system security by removing protections against unauthorized code execution and tampering.
                                    - You may receive fewer security alerts about system changes or potential threats,
                                      potentially reducing your awareness of important security events.

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > This action may lower your system's security, increasing its vulnerability to malicious software.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    This script disables:

                                    - The driver's service, identified as `MsSecCore` [3].
                                    - The driver's file, located at `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\drivers\msseccore.sys` [1] [3]

                                    This script disables the **Tamper Protection** feature.

                                    **Tamper Protection** is a security feature that blocks unauthorized changes to key **Defender Antivirus** settings [1] [2].
                                    These settings include real-time protection [1] [2], behavior monitoring [2], and cloud-delivered protection [1].
                                    By default, **Tamper Protection** is enabled [1].
                                    It is available in all editions of Windows since Windows 10, version 1903 [3].

                                    Disabling **Tamper Protection** may increase privacy and control over your system by allowing you to:

                                    - Change protected **Defender Antivirus** settings to enhance privacy [1] [3]
                                    - Disable **Defender Antivirus** entirely [1] [3] to increase privacy
                                    - Improve system performance by adjusting or disabling certain security features

                                    However, turning off **Tamper Protection** may reduce your system's security by:

                                    - Making your device more vulnerable to malware that attempts to disable security features
                                    - Allowing potentially harmful changes to important security settings

                                    With **Tamper Protection** enabled, users can modify protected settings through the **Windows Security** app [1].
                                    Disabling **Tamper Protection** allows changes through scripts and third-party apps such as privacy.sexy [1].

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    This script modifies the following registry keys:

                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Features!TamperProtection` [4] [5] [6].
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Features!TamperProtectionSource` [7]
                                    
                                    These keys interact with the `MpClient.dll` library within **Defender Antivirus** [8].
                                    The script sets values to replicate changes made through the **Windows Security** interface [5].

                                    Tests reveal the following values for various Windows versions:

                                    | Key | Opearting System | Default | After toggling ON | After toggling OFF |
                                    | --- | ------- | ------- | -------------------- | --------------------- |
                                    | `TamperProtection` | Windows 10 Pro (>= 22H2) | 1 | 5 [4] [6] | 4 [4] [6] [7] |
                                    | `TamperProtection` | Windows 11 Pro (>= 23H2) | 1 | 5 [4] [5] | 4 [4] [5] |
                                    | `TamperProtectionSource` | Windows 10 Pro (>= 22H2) | No value | No value | No value (Or 2 [7]) |
                                    | `TamperProtectionSource` | Windows 11 Pro (>= 23H2) | 5 | 2 | 2 |

                                    `TamperProtectionSource` value `2` means that the **Tamper Protection** is based on signatures.
                                    Other recorded values in various installations include `ATP` [9], `Service Init` [10], `Intune` [11],
                                    and `E5 transition` [12].
                                    However, these values lack official public documentation [13].

                                    To check the current **Tamper Protection** source, use this command:

                                    ```batchfile
                                    wmic /namespace:\\root\microsoft\windows\defender path MSFT_MpComputerStatus get /format:list | findstr "TamperProtectionSource"
                                    ````

                                    Or this PowerShell command:

                                    ```ps1
                                    Get-MpComputerStatus | Select-Object -ExpandProperty TamperProtectionSource
                                    ```

                                docs: |-
                                    This category disables **Defender System Guard**, a security feature in Windows.

                                    This feature is referred to as **Windows Defender System Guard** [1] [2], **System Guard** [3],
                                    and internally within Microsoft as **Octagon** [4].
                                    Introduced in Windows 10, version 1709 [1] [4], it is a set of system integrity features [1] [2].

                                    **System Guard** acts as an anti-tampering mechanism [4].
                                    It is a Windows component that protects system integrity during startup and runtime [1] [2] [3].
                                    It is included as part of the **Defender for Endpoint** suite [2].

                                    It features:

                                    - **System Integrity Protection:**
                                        - Protects and maintains system integrity during startup and runtime [1] [2] [3]
                                        - Validates system integrity through local and remote verification [1] [2] [3]
                                        - Ensures only signed and secure Windows files and drivers can start [1] [2]
                                    - **Critical Resource Protection:**
                                        - Safeguards critical resources (e.g., authentication stack, biometric stack) [2] [3]
                                        - Protects against System Management Mode (SMM) attacks [3]
                                    - **Hardware-Based Security:**
                                        - Uses hardware-based security features to prevent unauthorized software from running before Windows starts [1] [3]
                                        - Takes integrity measurements during boot using TPM 2.0 [2] [3]
                                    - **Remote Management and Analysis:**
                                        - Enables remote analysis of device integrity [1] [2]
                                        - Allows management systems (e.g., Intune, SCCM) to acquire integrity data [1] [2] [3]
                                        - Enables remote actions (e.g., denying resource access) for compromised devices [1] [2] [3]
                                        - This capability works by sending system integrity data to the Microsoft cloud and other third parties [5].

                                    Disabling System Guard enhances privacy by preventing remote analysis of your system.
                                    It also gives users more control, allowing changes to system components that are normally protected.
                                    This enables privacy modifications that require system-level changes, such as disabling other Defender features.

                                    However, disabling System Guard may reduce overall system security.
                                    It removes safeguards that prevent unauthorized system changes and malware infections during startup.
                                    This may increase your system's vulnerability to attacks.
                                    Using this on a work or school computer may violate organizational policies.

                                    > **Caution:** This action may expose your system to increased security risks.

                                            This script disables **System Guard Secure Launch**, a security feature in Windows.

                                            **Secure Launch** is also known as **Virtualization Based Security (VBS)** [1] or **firmware protection [2]**.
                                            This feature enhances startup security on Windows systems [2].
                                            It was initially introduced in Windows 10 version 1809 [3].

                                            It protects the **Virtualization Based Security (VBS)** environment from vulnerabilities in device firmware [4].
                                            **VBS**, in Windows, refers to a security technology that uses hardware virtualization to create isolated and secure environments,
                                            specifically for running sensitive operations and storing critical data [5].

                                            **Secure Launch** requires specific hardware support and is not compatible with all processors [2].
                                            It uses Intel **Trusted Execution Technology (TXT)** and **Runtime BIOS Resilience** to prevent firmware vulnerabilities
                                            from impacting the Windows VBS environment [4].
                                            All drivers on the system must be compatible with this feature, or the system may crash [4].

                                            Disabling it may enhance privacy by reducing the isolation of certain system components.
                                            This limits the system's ability to collect and potentially share data about the boot process and system state.
                                            Additionally, it increases user control over low-level system settings.
                                            This allows for more extensive privacy-focused configurations that may otherwise be restricted or overridden by
                                            the secure environment.

                                            Disabling this feature may also improve system performance by reducing the overhead of maintaining isolated environments. 

                                            However, this comes at the cost of potentially decreased protection against specific types of attacks.
                                            The Center for Internet Security (CIS) recommends enabling this feature for additional security on supported processors [4].

                                            > **Caution**: This action may weaken device security by removing protection from specific firmware-based attacks.

                                            This script disables the **System Guard Runtime Monitor LPAC (Least-Privileged AppContainer)** process.

                                            This process is part of the **System Guard Runtime Monitor (SGRM)** functionality [1] [2].

                                            - **SGRM** is a Windows security feature that monitors the system for potential tampering [1].
                                            - **LPAC (Least-Privileged AppContainer)** means this component operates in a restricted environment for enhanced security [3].

                                            Its exposes information through:

                                            - It uses RPC (Remote Procedure Call) functionality [1] [2].
                                              RPC allows different software programs to communicate, even if they are on different computers.
                                              The RPC endpoint can be called by anyone under the IID `a13a9961-953f-4157-8a29-e65e29be510d`,
                                              and makes use of the common `Wininet!Http*` family of APIs for the requests [1].
                                            - It communicates over the Internet [1] [2].
                                              It reports tampering attempts and sends system and regional information to Microsoft [1].
                                            - It logs information and uses **Windows ETW** (Event Tracing for Windows) for potential telemetry [2].

                                            It runs automatically in the background, triggered by the **System Guard Runtime Monitor Broker Service** (`SgrmBroker.exe`) [1].

                                            This script improves your privacy by preventing Windows from sending system integrity data to third parties.
                                            It can also enhance system performance by reducing background processes.

                                            However, disabling this component may reduce system security by removing a mechanism designed to detect system tampering.
                                            This may leave the system more vulnerable to certain types of attacks.

                                            > **Caution**: Disabling this feature weakens your system's protection against tampering and unauthorized modifications.

                                        docs: |-
                                            This script disables the **System Guard Runtime Monitor Agent**, a kernel driver within Windows' security infrastructure.

                                            The **System Guard Runtime Monitor Agent** is a kernel-mode component of System Guard that runs in the **Secure Kernel** [1].
                                            The Secure Kernel operates in a more secure and isolated environment called `VTL1` (Virtual Trust Level 1),
                                            while the normal NT kernel runs in a virtualized environment called `VTL0` [2].
                                            This separation adds another layer of security.

                                            It provides essential functionality to **System Guard** through various **assists** [1] [3] [4].
                                            These assists enable **System Guard**'s Lua-based assertion engine to interact with and validate system information [4].
                                            The driver gathers data from core system components like the NT kernel to monitor their integrity [4].
                                            It provides functionality to `SgrmBroker` (**System Guard Runtime Monitor Broker Service**) [3] [4].

                                            The agent performs security functions such as:

                                            - Checks for signed and trusted processes [4]
                                            - Enforces security policies [4]
                                            - Utilizes mitigation techniques like **Control Flow Guard** to prevent unauthorized code execution [4]
                                            - Provides kernel-level assists to the `SgrmBroker` assist engine, which runs in user-mode [4]
                                            - Prevents DLL hijacking attacks [7]

                                            Disabling this driver may enhance privacy by stopping system monitoring and data collection.
                                            It may also improve system performance by reducing background processes.
                                            However, it may reduce system security by disabling a component that protects against specific attacks.

                                            > **Caution**: Disabling this driver weakens your system's defenses against malware and unauthorized code execution.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            This script:

                                            - Disables the "System Guard Runtime Monitor Agent" service (`SgrmAgent`)
                                            - Deletes the "System Guard Runtime Monitor Agent" (`SgrmAgent.sys`) file

                                            The `SgrmAgent.sys` file is located at `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\drivers\SgrmAgent.sys` [3] [4] [5] [6].
                                            This service is installed by a Windows package called "Security-Octagon-Agent" [6].

                                            This script disables the **System Guard Runtime Monitor Broker** service and its associated process.

                                            The **System Guard Runtime Monitor Broker** service monitors and verifies Windows platform integrity [1] [2] [3] [4].
                                            It handles attestation and reporting functions [4] [5].
                                            It assists assertions of **System Guard Runtime Monitor (SGRM)** [4].
                                            This enables management systems such as **Intune** and **SCCM** to collect integrity data [4] [6] [7] [8].
                                            It supports remote actions such as blocking access to compromised devices [6] [7] [8].

                                            The service manages communication between the **System Guard** and other parts of Windows using Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) [4] [5].
                                            It uses **Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)** events, controlling and configuring ETW sessions [4] [5].
                                            This means the service collects and logs events.

                                            Disabling this service may enhance privacy by preventing system integrity data collection and reporting.
                                            It can also boost performance by reducing the service's resource usage.

                                            However, disabling this service may reduce security by preventing Windows from verifying system integrity
                                            and addressing threats.
                                            This may make the system more vulnerable to attacks.
                                            Additionally, using this script on a work or school computer may violate your organization's policies.

                                            > **Caution:** Disabling this service may decrease your system's security and make it more susceptible to threats.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            This script:

                                            - Disables the service (`SgrmBroker`).
                                            - Prevents its process (`SgrmBroker.exe`) from running.
                                            - Deletes its executable file (`SgrmBroker.exe`).

                                            This service is installed by the Windows package `Security-Octagon-Broker` [9].

                                            The service's process is located at:

                                            - `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\SgrmBroker.exe` [2] [5] [10] on Windows 10 and Windows 11 21H2.
                                            - `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\Sgrm\SgrmBroker.exe` [3] [9] on Windows 11 22H2 and above.

                                            `SgrmBroker.exe` is one of the user-mode components of the **System Guard Runtime Monitor**,
                                            and runs as a service named `OctBroker` (or `SgrmBroker`) [4].

                                            This script disables System Guard security checks, also called assertions.

                                            **System Guard assertions** are measurements of sensitive system properties in real time [1].
                                            They help detect subtle security threats by assessing the system's security [1].
                                            However, this monitoring may compromise privacy by sharing system health data with external services [1].

                                            This script enhances privacy by preventing the sharing of system health data.
                                            It may also improve performance by reducing the overhead from security checks. 
                                            However, disabling these assertions may reduce your protection against advanced threats.

                                            > **Caution**: This script may weaken your system's ability to detect threats.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            The script removes key files:

                                            - `SgrmAssertions.bin` [2] [3]: A compiled Lua script containing the assertions [2] [3]
                                            - `SgrmAssertions.cat` [2] [3]: A certificate used to verify the legitimacy of the assertions [2] [3]

                                            Located in `C:\Windows\System32\Sgrm\` [3] these files exist on Windows 10 (version 22H2 and later) and Windows 11 (version 21H2 and later).
                                            These files are part of the `Security-Octagon-SgrmAssertions` package [3].

                                            The **Secure Enclave** is also known as the **assertion engine** [1] [2].

                                            It is a core component of **System Guard** [1] [2].

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            The **Secure Enclave** is a core component of the **System Guard Runtime Monitor (SGRM)** [1].
                                            It uses Lua scripts to perform  assertions, which are loaded by a broker to avoid direct file I/O for security reasons [1].

                                            The System Guard Runtime Monitor Broker uses two DLL files as its assertion engine [1]:

                                            - `SgrmEnclave.dll`
                                            - `SgrmEnclave_secure.dll`

                                            These files are located in:

                                            - `%SYSTEMROOT%\Windows\System32\` on Windows 10 (version 22H2 and above) and Windows 11 (version 21H2)
                                            - `%SYSTEMROOT%\Windows\System32\Sgrm\` on Windows 11 (version 22H2 and above)

                                    VBS requires **Secure Boot** to run [1] [2].

                                    VBS includes a memory **integrity feature** [1], also called **hypervisor-protected code integrity (HVCI)** [1]
                                    and **hypervisor enforced code integrity** [1].
                                    It protects Windows by running kernel mode code integrity within the isolated virtual environment [1].

                                    Initially released as part of **Defender Device Guard** [1]
                                    this feature is now part of **Defender Application Control** [3] [4].
                                    Although the **Device Guard** brand is no longer used, it still appears in some Windows registry settings [1] [5].
                                    VBS and its memory integrity feature now operate independently [5].

                                    This script may enhance privacy by giving you more control over your system.
                                    VBS isolates kernel mode drivers and executables, preventing modifications [1].
                                    For example, you may want to disable Defender, which collects telemetry and personal data [6].
                                    Disabling Defender requires disabling its kernel drivers [7], which are protected by VBS.
                                    Disabling VBS allows for deeper system-level changes to improve privacy.

                                    This script may also improve system performance.
                                    VBS can slow down apps and games by 5 to 15% [8].

                                    However, disabling VBS has security implications:

                                    - It reduces protection against credential theft.
                                    - It makes the system more vulnerable to certain types of malware.
                                    - If you disable VBS, you will automatically disable **Credential Guard**, which relies on VBS [9].
                                      **Credential Guard** uses VBS to store credentials and other secrets in a protected environment [10].
                                      This environment is isolated from the operating system [10].

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > This action may reduce system security by removing protections that block malicious code from accessing critical components.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    This script modifies multiple registry keys to disable VBS and its features:

                                    - Disables VBS through:
                                      - `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard!EnableVirtualizationBasedSecurity` [8] [9] [11] [12] [13] [14]

                        docs: |-
                            This category provides scripts to disable Defender Antivirus.

                            Defender Antivirus, integrated into Windows, provides protection against viruses, ransomware, and other
                            types of malware [1] [2] [3].
                            
                            Disabling Defender Antivirus may improve system performance and privacy by stopping related data collection
                            However, disabling it may severely compromise your system's security if not complemented by proper security practices.
                            Carefully consider the trade-off before proceeding.

                            **Defender Antivirus** comes with following concerns:

                            - It sends files and personal data [4] to **Microsoft's Cloud Protection Service (MAPS)**
                              (also known as **Microsoft Active Protection Service** or **Microsoft SpyNet**) for analysis [5] [6].
                            - Recent Windows versions deeply integrate Defender with mechanisms like **Early Boot Anti-Malware**,
                              **Tamper Protection**, making it extremely difficult to remove or uninstall [7] [8].
                              This means that even if you want to stop using Defender for privacy reasons, these features make it
                              very difficult to do so using standard methods, keeping Microsoft's security and data collection systems
                              in place on your device.
                            - In 2020, Defender began flagging modifications to the hosts file that block Microsoft telemetry
                              as a security risk [8] [9].
                              This prevents you from easily stopping Microsoft's data collection on your device.
                            - It flags privacy scripts as malicious, even though their purpose is to enhance privacy [8] [9].
                              This discourages the use of tools designed to protect your personal data.
                            - Some reports suggest that Defender may consume significant system resources [10].

                            **Defender Antivirus** evolution milestones:

                            - Originally launched as **Windows AntiSpyware**, later renamed to **Windows Defender** [11].
                            - Replaced **Microsoft Security Essentials** in Windows 8 [12].
                            - **Windows Defender** is renamed to **Windows Defender Antivirus** in Windows 10 version 1703 [13].
                            - First included in **Windows Security Center (WSC)** in the 1809 update [14].
                              Later, it became part of the **Windows Security** suite [1] [2] [3] [7] [13].
                            - Renamed to **Microsoft Defender Antivirus** in the 2004 update [15].
                              However, it's still frequently referred to as Windows Defender, even by Microsoft in its current
                              documentation [1].

                            To check if Defender Antivirus is active, you can use the following commands in a PowerShell prompt:

                            - `Get-MpComputerStatus`: Displays the current state of Defender Antivirus [18].
                            - `Get-MpPreference`: Shows the current configuration settings of Defender Antivirus [19].

                            > **Caution:**
                            > Disabling antivirus protection may significantly reduce your system's security.
                            > Consider having alternative security measures in place and practicing safe computing habits.

                                            This script disables the **Defender Antivirus** Real-time Protection (RTP) module by
                                            removing its core library, `MpRtp.dll`.

                                            The `MpRtp.dll` library is also known as **AntiMalware Realtime Monitor** [1].
                                            It is a crucial component of **Defender Antivirus** [2] [3] [4] [5].
                                            It works with the **Microsoft Defender Antivirus Mini-Filter Driver** (`WdFilter.sys`) to intercept and
                                            scan file operations [5] [6].
                                            It functions as the **Real-time Protection** module [5] [7].
                                            It constantly monitors your system for threats [8].

                                            It includes features like:

                                            - **Device Control** policies to restrict the use of removable devices and printers [5].
                                            - **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** capabilities to prevent sensitive data from being leaked [5].
                                            - Monitors your system [9], including scanning files and processes [5]
                                            - Management of exclusions for files and processes that should not be scanned [5].
                                            - Real-time threat detection and actions based on configuration settings (e.g., block, allow, audit) [5].
                                            - Cloud-based protection and file submission to Microsoft [5]
                                            - Integration with Office applications and browsers for additional protection [5].
                                            - Communication with other Defender components [5]
                                            - Browser protection and network scanning [5]
                                            - **Controlled Folder Access** to protect against ransomware
                                            - Using Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) providers for security logging [3] [5]

                                            This script improves privacy by removing capabilities like sample submission and cloud communications.
                                            It prevents the system from monitoring processes for suspicious activities and logging events related to threat detections.
                                            It may also improve system performance, as some users have reported high CPU usage linked to this module [4].
                                            However, this may reduce your system's security by disabling real-time protection against malware and other threats.

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > Disabling real-time protection may expose your system to significant security risks.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            This script deletes the `MpRtp.dll` library from `%PROGRAMFILES%\Windows Defender\MpRtp.dll` [1] [2].
                                            On older versions of Windows, this file is located at `%PROGRAMDATA%\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\*\MpRtp.dll` [3].

                                            The `MpRtp.dll` library registers Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) providers for security logging [3] [5].
                                            It implements the following ETW providers [3]:

                                            | ETW Provider GUID | ETW Provider Name |
                                            | ----------------- | ----------------- |
                                            | `8E92DEEF-5E17-413B-B927-59B2F06A3CFC` | `Microsoft-Antimalware-RTP` |
                                            | `7AF898D7-7E0E-518D-5F96-B1E79239484C` | `Microsoft.Windows.Defender` |

                                                    This script disables the scheduled scans by the Malicious Software Removal Tool (MSRT) provided by Microsoft.

                                                    Starting from version 5.39 in August 2016, MSRT sends a "Heartbeat Report" to Microsoft every time it runs [1]. This behavior occurs even if certain user
                                                    preferences like the Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) are turned off or if "DiagTrack" is not on the computer [1]. A record of this "Successfully
                                                    Submitted Heartbeat Report" can be checked in the MRT log, found at `%SYSTEMROOT%\debug\mrt.log` [1].

                                                    By using this script, users enhance their privacy by preventing such automatic data transmissions to Microsoft.

                                        category: Disable Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI)
                                        docs: |-
                                            This category contains scripts that disable various components of
                                            the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) in Windows.

                                            AMSI is a standard interface that allows applications and services to
                                            integrate with antimalware products on Windows systems [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].
                                            It functions as an interception engine, enabling software to work with Defender
                                            and other antivirus solutions to detect potentially malicious scripts and content [1] [2] [3] [5].

                                            Key features of AMSI include:

                                            - Scanning scripts and macros for malicious content before execution [1] [2] [3] [5]
                                            - Providing an additional layer of security against script-based attacks [1] [2] [3] [5]
                                            - Allowing different antivirus vendors to conduct scanning operations [1] [3] [4] [5]

                                            Disabling AMSI components may enhance privacy by:

                                            - Reducing the amount of data collected and analyzed by antimalware services
                                              [1] [3] [5]
                                            - Limiting the sharing of potentially sensitive information with security
                                              providers [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]

                                            It may also improve system performance by:

                                            - Reducing script scanning overhead [5]
                                            - Decreasing background scanning activities

                                            However, disabling AMSI carries significant security risks:

                                            - Reduced protection against malicious scripts, including PowerShell commands and
                                              Microsoft Office macros [1] [2] [3] [5]
                                            - Weakened ability to detect and prevent malware, especially obfuscated threats [2] [3] [5]
                                            - Increased vulnerability to script-based attacks and potentially harmful software gaining
                                              control over the system

                                            > **Caution:**
                                            > Disabling AMSI components may significantly reduce your system's security.

                                                docs: |-
                                                    This script disables the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) provider for Defender.

                                                    The AMSI provider is part of the **Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI)** [1] [2].
                                                    AMSI adds security against malicious scripts in Windows [2].
                                                    It enables various antivirus programs to scan for script-based attacks [2].
                                                    AMSI provides interface to integrate antimalware modules [1] [3].

                                                    By default, Defender uses AMSI to block potentially harmful PowerShell scripts, JavaScript, and
                                                    VBA macros [2].
                                                    Windows registers an AMSI provider for **Defender Antivirus** to enable this functionality  [1] [2] [4] [5].

                                                    The main file for the AMSI provider is `MpOav.dll` [1] [3] [6] [7].
                                                    This file:
                                                    - Collects Defender's health data and logs [8]
                                                    - Decides about content from applications [3]
                                                    - May inject itself into other processes [8]
                                                    - Scans system memory [3]

                                                    Disabling the Defender AMSI provider may enhance your privacy by limiting the data Defender collects and analyzes.
                                                    It may also improve system performance by reducing script scanning overhead.

                                                    > **Caution:**
                                                    > This script may reduce your security by disabling a protection mechanism against malicious scripts.

                                                    This script disables the Defender UAC (User Account Control) AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) provider.

                                                    The UAC AMSI provider allows Defender to scan and analyze UAC elevation requests for potential security
                                                    threats [1].
                                                    UAC manages the elevation of privileges for executables, COM objects, MSI packages,
                                                    and ActiveX installations [1].
                                                    UAC elevation on Windows is a security feature that asks for permission before allowing
                                                    changes that could affect the system's operation.

                                                    Disabling this provider may enhance privacy by reducing the amount of data scanned and analyzed
                                                    during UAC elevation requests.
                                                    It may also improve system performance by removing this security check.
                                                    However, disabling this component may reduce your system's ability to detect and prevent malware exploiting UAC elevation.

                                                    > **Caution:**
                                                    > This script may reduce your computer's security by disabling a feature that helps prevent

                                                    ### Technical Details

                                                    This script targets the **Windows Defender IAmsiUacProvider** implementation [2] [3].
                                                    This provider integrates with the `WinDefend` service [3] [4] [5].
                                                    The `WinDefend` service runs `MpSvc.dll` [6], which utilizes this component as a UAC provider [5].

                                                    The script removes the application COM registration for CLSID and AppID
                                                    `2781761E-28E2-4109-99FE-B9D127C57AFE` [2] [4] [7] by deleting the following registry keys:

                                                    - `HKLM\Software\Classes\Wow6432Node\AppID\{2781761E-28E2-4109-99FE-B9D127C57AFE}` [7]
                                                    - `HKLM\Software\Classes\CLSID\{2781761E-28E2-4109-99FE-B9D127C57AFE}` [3] [7]

                                                    It also removes the UacProviders registration under:
                                                    `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\AMSI\UacProviders\{2781761E-28E2-4109-99FE-B9D127C57AFE}` [5] [7].

                                                    Office macros, even if they are obfuscated [2].

                                                    When AMSI is enabled, antivirus programs can scan scripts before they run [2].
                                                    If a known malicious pattern is detected, the script may be blocked [2].

                                                    Disabling AMSI may enhance privacy by limiting data shared with antimalware services.
                                                    It may also boost system performance by reducing background scanning activities.

                                                    However, disabling AMSI poses significant security risks:

                                                    1. Reduced protection from script-based attacks
                                                    2. Weakened detection of malicious macros
                                                    3. Increased vulnerability to obfuscated malware

                                                    > **Caution:**
                                                    > Disabling AMSI weakens your defense against malware and script-based threats.

                                docs: |-
                                    This category contains scripts that disable Defender Antivirus management capabilities.

                                    Defender Antivirus uses management features to control how it works, collect system data,
                                    and change settings on your device or remotely [1].
                                    These management features let system administrators monitor, configure, and control
                                    Defender's behavior across multiple devices [1].
                                    Defender needs these features to perform tasks like automated virus scans [2].

                                    Disabling these management features enhances privacy by:

                                    - Preventing Windows from collecting system data through these features
                                    - Blocking remote access to Defender settings
                                    - Ensuring your privacy settings stay unchanged

                                    It may improve system performance by:

                                    - Reducing background processes and overall system resource usage
                                    - Lowering startup time by minimizing initial Defender-related tasks
                                    - Reducing disk operations to improve storage performance

                                    It may increase security by:

                                    - Reducing ways attackers may access your system
                                    - Preventing unauthorized changes to security settings

                                    However, disabling these features may reduce security by:

                                    - Limiting the ability to configure Defender through standard tools
                                    - Blocking workplace IT from managing your device
                                    - Disrupting Defender's automated tasks, which rely on these tools to function effectively [2]

                                    > **Caution:**
                                    > These changes may reduce your system's security features and prevent IT administrators
                                    > from managing your device's security settings.

                                            This script disables `MpClient.dll`, the **Defender Antivirus** command-line library.

                                            Microsoft refers to this library as the **Client Interface** [1].
                                            It's a crucial component of **Defender Antivirus** [2] [3].
                                            It allows Windows and third-party processes to manage **Defender Antivirus** [3] [4].

                                            It contains functions for:

                                            - Scanning for viruses [3] [4] [5]
                                            - Detecting threats [3] [4]
                                            - Updating the antivirus [3] [4]
                                            - Configuring antivirus features [3] [4]
                                            - Submitting samples and telemetry data [3]
                                            - Managing exclusions and **Defender Exploit Guard** [3]
                                            - Logging system security state [2] [3]
                                            - Security and certificate validation [3]
                                            - Communication with other Windows processes through COM [3].

                                            This library is used by various Defender command-line tools, such as:

                                            - `MpCmdRun.exe` (**Defender Antivirus** CLI) [6]
                                            - `MpDlpCmd.exe` (**Microsoft Endpoint DLP** CLI) [6].

                                            This script may enhance privacy by disabling telemetry and data submission functions of **Defender Antivirus**.
                                            It may also enhance system performance by reducing background processes.
                                            However, there are trade-offs:

                                            - It disables command-line tools for managing **Defender Antivirus**.
                                            - It may weaken your system's protection against malware and other threats.

                                            > **Caution:** This script weakens your computer's built-in security features.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            This script deletes the `MpRtp.dll` library from:

                                            - `%PROGRAMFILES%\Windows Defender\MpClient.dll` [1] [3] [7]
                                            - `%PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Windows Defender\MpClient.dll` [1]

                                            On older versions of Windows, this file is located at
                                            `%PROGRAMDATA%\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\*\Drivers\MpClient.dll` [2] [7].

                                            Microsoft states that deleting this file prevents **Defender Antivirus** from functioning as the default antivirus [7].

                                            The library also registers Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) providers for security logging [2]:

                                            | ETW Provider GUID | ETW Provider Name |

                                            This process is also known as the **Microsoft Defender Antivirus command-line utility** [1] [2] [3].
                                            The utility is part of **Defender for Endpoint** [1] and **Defender Antivirus** [2] [4].
                                            It automates **Defender Antivirus** tasks [4].
                                            It runs scheduled background tasks automatically [3].
                                            It can be used to:

                                            - Start scans [4]
                                            - Start diagnostic tracing [4]
                                            - Capture and save network input [4]
                                            - Collect diagnostic data [4]
                                            - Manage security signatures [4]
                                            - Manage quarantined items [4]
                                            - Verify **Defender Antivirus cloud service** communication [4]
                                            - Check exclusions [4]

                                            The **Defender Antivirus cloud service** is also known as
                                            **Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS)** [4] [5] [6] [7] or **SpyNet** [6] [7].
                                            This service collects data about your computer, files, and software and sends it to Microsoft [5].

                                            Disabling this process can enhance privacy by preventing the automatic collection and transmission of
                                            diagnostic data to Microsoft.
                                            It may also improve system performance by reducing background processes.

                                            However, this action may decrease your system's security by stopping **Defender Antivirus** from performing
                                            scans and other protective tasks.

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > Disabling this process may reduce your computer's defenses against malware and other security threats.

                                            This script disables Defender's ability to be managed through Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

                                            WMI enables the management and automation of tasks on Windows computers [1].
                                            WMI is primarily used for remote management and monitoring but it can also operate locally [1].

                                            Disabling Defender's WMI management enhances privacy by preventing unauthorized remote modifications
                                            to Defender settings.
                                            It may also improve system performance by reducing background processes related to WMI management.

                                            However, this change comes with trade-offs:

                                            - It may disrupt local management scripts on your computer [1].
                                            - It can impact computers managed by enterprise software such as **System Center Operations Manager**
                                            or **Windows Remote Management** [1].
                                            - It may reduce security by limiting the ability to manage Defender remotely in enterprise environments.

                                            > **Caution:**
                                            > This script may interfere with system management tools and potentially reduce security in enterprise environments.

                                            This category contains scripts to disable remote management capabilities of Defender Antivirus.

                                            Remote management allows administrators or management systems to control Defender settings and receive information remotely.
                                            This includes applying configurations, running scans, and collecting device security data.

                                            Disabling remote management enhances your privacy by:

                                            - Preventing remote access to your Defender settings and data.
                                            - Reducing the amount of information shared with management systems.
                                            - Giving you more control over your local security settings.

                                            It also increases your security by:

                                            - Reducing potential attack surface for remote exploits.
                                            - Preventing unauthorized changes to your Defender settings.

                                            It can also boost system performance by removing associated components.

                                            However, disabling remote management can interfere with organizational settings and potentially reduce security by:

                                            - Preventing automatic application of security policies.
                                            - Limiting the ability of IT administrators to manage and monitor security across devices.
                                            - Potentially missing important security updates or configurations.

                                                    This script disables Windows Defender's ability to receive remote configurations.

                                                    Windows Defender Management uses this feature to remotely control Defender's behavior [1].
                                                    It uses a Configuration Service Provider (CSP) as an interface between the device's settings and
                                                    specified configurations [2].
                                                    CSPs, like Group Policy client-side extensions, enable reading, setting, modifying, or deleting
                                                    settings for specific features [2].
                                                    Mobile device management (MDM) service providers commonly use these CSPs [2].

                                                    Disabling this feature enhances privacy and user control by blocking remote modifications to your
                                                    Defender settings.
                                                    This action may also improve system performance by reducing background processes related to
                                                    checking and applying remote configurations.

                                                    However, this action may reduce security by:

                                                    - Preventing potentially important security updates from being applied automatically.
                                                    - Limiting the ability of IT administrators to manage Defender settings across devices.

                                            This script disables the `ConfigSecurityPolicy.exe` process.

                                            This process is also known as **Microsoft Security Client Policy Configuration Tool** [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6].
                                            It was formerly known as **Microsoft Security Client Policy Configure** [7].

                                            This tool is part of **Defender Antivirus** [3] [8] [9], **Defender for Endpoint** [1] [2] and the **Security Configuration Engine** [5].
                                            The **Security Configuration Engine** handles security configuration requests on Windows [10].
                                            The engine functions as an extension of the **Local Group Policy Editor** for security settings [10].

                                            It is used for managing security policies and settings [3] [4] [5] [8] [9] [11] [12].
                                            These settings include user account control, password policies, audit policies, and other security-related settings [11].

                                            The tool allows remote management over the Internet [3] [5] [13] through:

                                            - **Configuration Manager** [4] [8]
                                            - **Microsoft Intune** [4] [8]
                                            - **System Center Endpoint Protection** [12]

                                            It tracks and logs the status of policy enforcement [9], which may expose system data.

                                            This script improves your privacy by:

                                            - Preventing automatic policy updates from Microsoft servers
                                            - Reducing data collection and communication with Microsoft services
                                            - Limiting remote management capabilities that may be used to monitor system behavior

                                            This script also improves your security by removing a potential attack target.
                                            Malicious actors may exploit this tool to:

                                            - Download harmful software [3] [5]
                                            - Extract sensitive data [3] [5]
                                            - Execute unauthorized code [5]
                                            - Disable security features [5]

                                            This script may improve system performance by:

                                            - Reducing background processes
                                            - Decreasing startup time
                                            - Lowering system resource usage

                                            However, disabling this tool presents the following security risks:

                                            - May prevent automatic security policy updates
                                            - May leave the system vulnerable to threats that could be blocked by updated policies
                                            - May prevent administrators from managing security settings in work or school environments, potentially violating organizational policies

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > Disabling this tool may reduce protection against malware and other security threats.

                                        docs: |-
                                            This script disables **Defender Antivirus**'s boot-time logging.

                                            **Defender Antivirus** uses AutoLogger sessions [1].
                                            The **AutoLogger** event tracing session records events that occur early in the operating system boot process [2].
                                            Applications and device drivers can use the AutoLogger session to capture traces before the user logs in [2].

                                            Disabling these loggers reduces the data **Defender Antivirus** collects during system startup.
                                            This may increase privacy by limiting the information gathered about your system's early boot process.
                                            Disabling these boot-time loggers may improve startup performance by reducing logging overhead during boot.

                                            However, this script may have security implications:

                                            - **Reduced threat detection:**
                                              Disabling these boot loggers may limit **Defender Antivirus**'s ability to detect and respond to early-stage
                                              malware or threats that activate during system startup.
                                            - **Decreased diagnostic capabilities:**
                                              These boot logs can be useful for troubleshooting system issues.
                                              Disabling them may make it more difficult to diagnose certain problems if they occur.

                                            > **Caution**: This action may reduce malware detection during system startup, potentially increasing security risks.

                                            This service is also referred to as **Microsoft Defender Antivirus Service** [1] [2] and **Windows Defender Service** [2].
                                            It is a core component of Microsoft Defender Antivirus, essential for its operation [1] [3].

                                            Using these scripts offers two benefits:

                                            - **Enhanced Privacy:** Limits Microsoft's data collection on your files and system activity.
                                            - **Improved Performance:** Reduces system resource usage by limiting background processes and scans.

                                            However, disabling these components may reduce your system's security:

                                            - No immediate alerts when malware or viruses are detected.
                                            - Weakened defense against ransomware and other cyber threats.
                                            - Increased vulnerability to emerging security threats.
                                            - Some Windows security features may stop working.

                                            > **Caution:** Disabling Microsoft Defender Antivirus may expose your system to malware and other security threats.

                                                    Disabling this service comes at a cost:

                                                    - It reduces your system's security by removing real-time malware protection.
                                                    - It may also impair other Defender products, such as **Defender for Endpoint** [4].
                                                    - It interrupts the functionality of the `Set-MpPreference` PowerShell cmdlet.
                                                      This cmdlet is used to configure Defender scans and updates [5].

                                                    ### Technical Details

                                                    This service runs the `MsMpEng.exe` executable [6] [7].
                                                    This executable is also known as **Microsoft Defender Antivirus service executable** [4] or **Antimalware Service Executable** [1].
                                                    It's located at:

                                                    - On modern Windows versions:
                                                      - `%PROGRAMFILES%\Windows Defender` [4] [6] [7]
                                                    - On older versions of Windows:
                                                      - `%PROGRAMDATA%\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\*\MsMpEng.exe` [8]
                                                      - `%PROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft Security Client` on older versions [4].

                                                    Attempting to use the `Set-MpPreference` cmdlet in PowerShell after disabling the service results in an error.
                                                    Here's an example:

                                                    ```
                                                    $ Set-MpPreference -Force -MAPSReporting 0

                                                    Set-MpPreference: Operation failed with the following error: 0x800106ba. Operation: Set-MpPreference.
                                                    Target: MAPS_MAPSReporting. FullyQualifiedErrorId : HRESULT 0x800106ba,Set-MpPreference.
                                                    ```

                                                docs: |-
                                                    This script disables **Defender Antivirus** from running in Safe Mode.

                                                    **Safe Mode** is also known as **Safe Boot** [1].
                                                    It starts Windows in a limited state where only essential services and drivers are loaded [1].
                                                    By default, the Defender Antivirus service is set to run in this mode [1] [2].

                                                    This script improves privacy in Safe Mode by preventing Defender Antivirus from:

                                                    - Collecting system data
                                                    - Scanning files
                                                    - Sending telemetry data to Microsoft
    
                                                    This also increases system speed in Safe Mode by reducing background processes and memory usage.

                                                    However, running this script may compromise your security by leaving your system unprotected from malware
                                                    and other threats, even in Safe Mode.

                                                    > **Caution**:
                                                    > This script removes protection against viruses and other threats in Safe Mode.

                                                    ### Technical Details

                                                    The script deletes two registry keys:

                                                    - `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Minimal\WinDefend` [2]
                                                    - `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot\Network\WinDefend` [2]

                                                    These registry keys are created by the Windows Defender Service (`Windows-Defender-Service.Resources`) package
                                                    to enable antivirus functionality in Safe Mode [2].

                                                    This script configures Windows to stop the Defender Antivirus service when antivirus protection is disabled.

                                                    The **Microsoft Defender Antivirus service** was formerly called the **Antimalware Service** [1].
                                                    This service is one of the core components of Defender Antivirus [1] [2].
                                                    It raises privacy concerns because it sends files to Microsoft servers for analysis [2].

                                                    By default, Windows stops this service when antivirus features are disabled [3] [4] [5].
                                                    This script enforces this default behavior to consistently and persistently.
                                                    This behavior is recommended by Microsoft [3] [4] [5].

                                                    This script does not disable any security features on its own.
                                                    It only controls whether the service stays running after antivirus protection has been disabled
                                                    through other means.

                                                    This script enhances privacy by reducing potential security monitoring.
                                                    It may also improve system performance by freeing up resources when the antivirus is not in use.

                                                    ### Technical Details

                                                    After applying this script:

                                                    - The Defender Antivirus service stops when both antivirus and antispyware protections are disabled [3] [4] [5].

                                                    This script configures **Defender Antivirus** to start with a lower priority.

                                                    By default, Windows runs the Defender Antivirus service (also called the **Antimalware Service** [1])
                                                    with normal priority [2] [3] [4] [5].
                                                    This script changes the startup priority to low [2] [3] [4] [5].

                                                    This enhances privacy by reducing background scanning and potentially limiting data collection during Windows startup.
                                                    It may improve system performance by reducing resource usage for the antivirus during startup [2] [3] [4] [5].

                                                    Lowering the priority may delay antivirus initialization, potentially leaving a brief window where the system is less protected.
                                                    However, MITRE, a leading cybersecurity organization, does not consider this a security vulnerability [5].

                                                    > **Caution:** This action may delay antivirus protection initialization.

                                                    - When a third-party antivirus is installed, Windows typically sets this value to `0` [2].

                                                    - The `MpSvc.dll` [6] and `MpClient.dll` [7] files read this registry value to manage Defender Antivirus operations.

                                                    This script disables the running state of the Defender Antivirus service.

                                                    Setting the service to 'not running' prevents activation of any components dependent on the Defender service
                                                    (also called the **Antimalware Service** [1]).
                                                    This gives you more control over Defender's operations.

                                                    This script enhances privacy by preventing Defender Antivirus from running in the background, which stops potential
                                                    unwanted data collection and system scans.
                                                    It may also boost system performance by stopping Defender Antivirus-related processes from using system resources.

                                                    However, this may reduce security by keeping Defender Antivirus inactive, which may increase your system's vulnerability to threats.

                                                    > **Caution:**
                                                    > Disabling the running state of Defender may leave your system unprotected against malware and other security threats.

                                                    ### Technical Details

                                                    This script sets the `IsServiceRunning` registry value in the Windows Defender registry key to `0`.

                                                    This modification means:

                                                    - `0` means the service is not running; `1` means it is running [2] [3] [4].
                                                    - The default value varies: tests show that it is `1` on a fresh installation of Windows 11, but absent on Windows 10 [4].
                                                    - This registry value is read by `MpClient.dll` [5] and `MpSvc.dll` [6], which are related to Defender Antivirus operations.
                                                    - Windows typically deletes this key during shutdown to prevent false-positive dirty shutdown detections [6].
                                                        - A **dirty shutdown** happens when a computer is shut down without completing the proper shutdown process [7].
                                                    - The value may change automatically when Defender updates [8].

                                                    This script removes a configuration value that controls where Defender stores its data.

                                                    This is a configuration related to **Defender Antivirus** [1].
                                                    Windows configures this setting when installing Defender Antivirus service [2].
                                                    It specifies where data, including virus definition databases and other detection files, is installed [3].
                                                    It is used by various Defender components like `MpClient.dll` [4], `MpSvc.dll` [5], `MsMpEng.exe` [6] and `MpCmdRun.exe` [7].

                                                    Deleting this value enhances privacy by preventing these components from accessing their data directories.
                                                    This reduces their data collection capabilities.

                                                    However, this change has significant security risks:

                                                    - It may weaken Defender Antivirus's ability to detect and remove malware
                                                    - Some security features of Defender Antivirus may not work properly
                                                    - This may make your system more vulnerable to security threats

                                                    > **Caution**: This action may leave your system less protected against viruses and malware.

                                                    ### Technical Details

                                                    The script deletes the `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender!ProductAppDataPath` registry value [1] [2].
                                                    In earlier Windows versions, this value was found at `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Antimalware!ProductAppDataPath` [3].

                                                    When this value is removed, Windows logs Event ID 5007 [1].
                                                    The event message states [1]:

                                                    ```
                                                    Microsoft Defender Antivirus Configuration has changed.
                                                    If this is an unexpected event you should review the settings as this may be the result of malware.
                                                    ```

                                                    According to tests, Windows 10 Pro (≥ 22H2) and Windows 11 Pro (≥ 21H2) have protective measures that
                                                    may prevent this change from taking effect or may quickly reverse it.

                                                    Microsoft refers to `MpSvc.dll` as the **Service Module** [1] [2].
                                                    It is part of **Defender Antivirus** service [3].

                                                    It manages essential Defender Antivirus functions, including:

                                                    - **Scans:** Monitors files in real-time, protects network, manages scans [4]
                                                    - **Updates:** Downloads new virus definitions [4]
                                                    - **Threats:** Finds and removes malware [4]

                                                    - **Integrations**: Works with **Windows Security Center** and antimalware scanning (AMSI) [4]

                                                    This script improves privacy by:

                                                    - Reducing data collection and reporting to Microsoft
                                                    - Preventing system monitoring [4]
                                                    - Allowing more control over privacy-related settings, including the ability to disable Defender Antivirus [5]

                                                    The script may improve system performance by:

                                                    - Reducing background scanning activities
                                                    - Decreasing memory usage
                                                    - Lowering CPU usage from real-time protection

                                                    Disabling `MpSvc.dll` reduces potential attack vectors that have been exploited in REvil ransomware [6],
                                                    state-sponsored attacks [7], and the Clambing backdoor [8].

                                                    However, disabling it also impairs critical security functions such as real-time protection, security
                                                    definition updates and threat detection capabilities.

                                                    > Disabling this component may increase your computer's risk of viruses and other security threats.

                                                    ### Technical Details

                                                    Defender Antivirus service runs `MsMpEng.exe` on modern versions of Windows [9].
                                                    `MsMpEng.exe` loads this DLL [6] [8] [10] [11].
                                                    This DLL activates core antivirus functions via `MpEngine.dll` [11] [12].
                                                    It interacts with other applications using an ALPC port labeled `IMpService` [13].

                                                    Location on modern Windows:

                                                    - `%PROGRAMFILES%\Windows Defender\mpsvc.dll` [2] [3] [10]

                                                    Historical locations on older Windows versions:

                                                    - `%PROGRAMFILES64%\Windows Defender\mpsvc.dll` [1]
                                                    - `%PROGRAMDATA%\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\<version number>\MpSvc.dll` [2] [10]
                                                    - `%PROGRAMFILES\Microsoft Security Client\MpSvc.dll` [2]

                                                    This script removes the `MpCommu.dll` library, disabling its functionality.

                                                    Microsoft refers to this library as **Communication Module** [1] [2] [3].
                                                    This library is a component of **Defender Antivirus** service [4] [5].

                                                    It performs several network-related functions:

                                                    - Communicates with Microsoft servers over HTTP/HTTPS using REST/SOAP APIs and proxy support [5].
                                                    - Manages updates, including scheduling and downloading antimalware definition
                                                      updates and interacting with **Windows Update** [5].
                                                    - Submits reports to **SpyNet** [5], also known as **Microsoft Active Protection Service (MAPS)** [6].
                                                    - Reports errors [5].
                                                    - Interacts with other Windows processes using COM (Component Object Model) [5].
                                                    - Manages configurations and settings related to malware protection [5].

                                                    Removing this library enhances privacy by preventing data transmission to Microsoft servers,
                                                    including **SpyNet** reporting and other communications.
                                                    This action may also slightly improve system performance by eliminating background communications and update processes
                                                    associated with the module.

                                                    However, removing this library reduces system security.
                                                    Without this library, **Defender Antivirus** may not receive malware definition updates, leaving your system vulnerable to new threats.
                                                    Error reporting and other security features may also be disabled.

                                                    > **Caution**: Removing this library may leave your system unprotected from new malware and security threats.

                                                    ### Technical Details

                                                    The script removes the `MpCommu.dll` file from its standard location:

                                                    In older versions of Windows, this file is located at:

                                                    - `%PROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft Security Client\Antimalware\MpCommu.dll` [2]

                                                name: Disable Defender Antivirus service communication with apps
                                                docs: |-
                                                    This script prevents **Defender Antivirus** from communicating with other applications.

                                                    The script blocks communication by removing components that allow Defender Antivirus to share data with other programs.
                                                    Windows enables applications to communicate and share data using *interprocess communications (IPC)* [1].
                                                    This communication is achieved through the *Component Object Model (COM)* [1].
                                                    COM lets programs communicate and share data with other programs [1].
                                                    Programs communicate across computer networks [1].

                                                    This script enhances privacy by limiting system monitoring and data collection.
                                                    It may also improve system performance by reducing background processes and resource usage.

                                                    However, disabling these components may significantly reduce system security.
                                                    Without these components, your system becomes vulnerable to malware, ransomware, and other cyber attacks.

                                                    > **Caution:** This action disables your antivirus protection, exposing your computer to viruses and other cyber threats.

                                                    ### Technical Details

                                                    These components belong to **Defender Antivirus** and its main service [2].
                                                    Windows updates and installs these through the `Windows-Defender-Service.Resources` package [2].

                                                    Defender COM objects use two main files:

                                                    - `%PROGRAMFILES%\Windows Defender\MpAsDesc.dll` [2] [3]
                                                      - This file provides icons and language support to COM objects [2] [3]
                                                      - Multiple Defender security services use it, including `WdNisDrv`, `WdBoot`, `WinDefend`, `WdNisSvc` [4] [5].
                                                      - This script will not remove this file as it affects multiple services.
                                                    - `%PROGRAMFILES%\Windows Defender\MsMpCom.dll` [2] [3]
                                                      - It functions as an in-process COM server [2] [3].

                                                    The script disables the following components:

                                                    - Microsoft Windows Defender

                                                      - `IMsMpClientUtils` (`E2D74550-8E41-460E-BB51-52E1F9522134`) [2]
                                                      - `IMsMpSimpleConfig` (`CDFED399-7999-4309-B064-1EDE04BC580D`) [2]

                                        docs: |-
                                            This script disables Defender's device monitoring by removing the driver file `WdDevFlt.sys`.

                                            Microsoft refers to this file as **Microsoft antimalware device filter driver** [2].
                                            This driver belongs to **Defender Antivirus** [1] [2] [3].
                                            It allows Defender to monitor devices you connect, including USB drives, displays, and audio devices [2].

                                            This script improves privacy by:

                                            - Preventing Defender from monitoring device connections and activities
                                            - Reducing tracking of device activity at the system level
                                            - Limiting data collection about connected devices

                                            It may improve system performance by:

                                            - Reduces background processes that monitor your devices
                                            - Uses less system resources when connecting devices
                                            - May speed up device connections

                                            However, it may reduce security by:

                                            - Limiting Defender's ability to detect malicious USB devices
                                            - Reducing protection against harmful device-based attacks
                                            - Decreasing system's capability to identify compromised hardware

                                            > **Caution:** This makes your system more vulnerable to attacks from malicious USB drives and other devices.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            The system file `WdDevFlt.sys` comes with Defender's drivers package [1].
                                            The script removes the driver file from `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\drivers\WdDevFlt.sys` [4].

                                            This script disables the **Defender Antivirus Network Inspection Service** (`WdNisSvc`)
                                            and its process, `NisSrv.exe`.

                                            This service is also known as:

                                            - **Microsoft Defender Antivirus Network Inspection Service** [1] [2]
                                            - **Windows Defender Antivirus Network Inspection Service** [3]
                                            - **Windows Defender Network Inspection Service** [4]
                                            - **NIS** [5]

                                            This service inspects network traffic to detect known vulnerabilities, aiming to protect against network-based attacks [1] [4].
                                            It is part of **Defender Antivirus** [2] and **Defender for Endpoint** [6].

                                            It serves as Microsoft's zero-day vulnerability protection feature, blocking network traffic matching known
                                            exploits against unpatched vulnerabilities [5].
                                            When a new unpatched vulnerability affecting Microsoft products is discovered, Microsoft releases a signature
                                            to block that exploit on machines with this feature enabled [5].
                                            This feature performs **synchronous inspection** when activated, introducing latency and consuming additional resources [5].

                                            This service comes preinstalled on Windows [4] and runs continuously in the background.

                                            Disabling this service may enhance privacy by reducing data sent to Microsoft.
                                            By default, Defender Antivirus reports detected attacks to Microsoft [7].
                                            This automatically sends your network information to Microsoft.

                                            Disabling this service may also boost system performance by reducing resource consumption.
                                            Synchronous inspection may cause latency, lower network throughput, and increase memory and CPU consumption [5].
                                            According to Microsoft, this feature is not suitable for machines with high network-intensive server roles such as IIS, Exchange, and SQL [5].

                                            However, disabling this service may reduce your security.
                                            It prevents zero-day vulnerability shielding signatures from loading on your machine [5].
                                            This may leave you vulnerable to new network-based attacks until patches are applied.

                                            > **Caution**: Disabling this service may expose your system to unpatched network vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of security breaches.

                                            - Blocks execution of the `NisSrv.exe` process

                                            The script disables both the service and its process for persistent disabling.
                                            Disabling the service alone may be insufficient, as software like **Configuration Manager** can re-enable it [3].

                                            `NisSrv.exe` is the process that provides functionality to this service [2] [6].
                                            It is known as **Microsoft Defender Antivirus Network Realtime Inspection service** [2].
                                            The process is located at:

                                            - `%PROGRAMFILES%\Windows Defender` [6] [8] on modern versions of Windows
                                            - `%PROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft Security Client` [6] on older versions of Windows.

                                            This script disables the Microsoft Defender Core service (`MDCoreSvc`).

                                            The Microsoft Defender Core service is a component of **Defender Antivirus** [1] [2].
                                            It is included in **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** suite. [1] [2] [3].
                                            It contributes to the stability and performance of Defender Antivirus [1].

                                            This script improves privacy by disabling this service.
                                            It reduces data collection associated with Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.

                                            It may also increase system performance by removing a background process.

                                            However, disabling this service may reduce system security.
                                            As a core operating system component, its removal may also affect system stability.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            The service is technically identified as `MDCoreSvc` [1] [2] [4] [5].
                                            Its executable is `MpDefenderCoreService.exe` [1] [2] [5] [6].
                                            This process is also known as "Antimalware Core Service" [1] [2] [6].
                                            It's typically located in the `%PROGRAMDATA%\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\<version number>\`
                                            folder [6].
                                            It may be found on modern versions of Windows [5].

                                            ### Overview of default service statuses

                                            According to tests, the availability of this service varies across different Windows versions,

                                    This script disables the license module library of **Defender Antivirus**.

                                    This component is known as the **License Module** [1].
                                    It is a component of **Defender Antivirus** service [2], formerly known as **System Center Endpoint Protection** [3].

                                    This library manages licensing aspects, such as product validation and configuration management [4].
                                    It is involved in online verification of digital certificates and time stamps [4].
                                    It's also part of **Defender Offline**'s lightweight scanner [5].

                                    By disabling this library, the script may enhance your privacy by preventing potential online connections
                                    for license verification.

                                    It may also slightly improve system boot performance by reducing the number of components loaded at startup.

                                    However, this action may reduce your security by interfering with Defender's ability to validate its license and
                                    potentially limiting some of its functionalities.
                                    Disabling core components of your antivirus software may leave your system more vulnerable to threats.

                                docs: |-
                                    This category contains scripts to disable maintenance tasks of **Defender Antivirus**.

                                    Scheduled tasks are automated operations that Windows runs at specific times or events [1].
                                    Defender uses these tasks to maintain its antivirus service [2].

                                    Disabling these tasks enhances privacy by:

                                    - Stopping automatic data collection
                                    - Giving you control over data collection and deletion

                                    Disabling these tasks can also improve system performance by:

                                    - Reducing background processes
                                    - Decreasing boot time
                                    - Reducing resource usage
                                    - Saving disk space

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > Disabling these tasks may weaken your system's security by turning off antivirus features.
                                    > Consider using alternative security measures.

                                            This script disables the Defender Antivirus cache maintenance task scheduled task.

                                            Microsoft refers to this task as:

                                            - Windows Defender Cache Maintenance [1] [2] [3] [4]
                                            - Periodic maintenance task [1]

                                            This task is a **Defender Antivirus** component [1] [2].
                                            The task is scheduled to periodically maintain the cache used by Defender Antivirus [1].

                                            Cache maintenance involves managing temporary files that Microsoft Defender is either scanning or has quarantined [5].
                                            Disabling this task prevents the system from automatically clearing the Defender cache [5].

                                            Disabling this task may improve your privacy by preventing automatic removal of quarantined files or cached
                                            data without your explicit action.
                                            For example, when Defender mistakenly flag privacy scripts (such as privacy.sexy scripts [3]) as a threat
                                            and quarantines it, the cache maintenance task may remove this file without your knowledge.
                                            By disabling the task, you prevent automatic deletion, giving you the opportunity to recover and review such files.
                                            This is useful for users who handle sensitive data and want full control over file management on their system.

                                            Disabling this task is reported to optimize system boot speed [4], but it may lead to increased storage use
                                            by temporary files.

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > Disabling this task may lead to a buildup of unnecessary files, potentially affecting system performance over time.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            It runs the command `%PROGRAMFILES%\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe -IdleTask -TaskName WdCacheMaintenance` [1] [2].

                                            Microsoft refers to this task as:

                                            - Windows Defender Scheduled Scan [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
                                            - Periodic scan task [3] [4] [6]

                                            This task is a component of **Defender Antivirus** [1] [2] [6].
                                            It performs automatic regular antivirus scans [1] [6].

                                            Disabling this task may enhance your privacy by giving you more control over when and how often
                                            your system is scanned.
                                            It may also improve system performance by reducing background processes.

                                            However, regular scans are a key part of maintaining system security.
                                            Disabling this task means your computer will not automatically perform scheduled antivirus scans,
                                            which may leave your system more vulnerable to malware if you don't manually run scans regularly.

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > This action may leave your computer more vulnerable to malware if you don't follow good security

                                            Disabling this task may improve privacy by reducing the system state data stored on the device.

                                            It may also boost system performance by preventing unnecessary system slowdowns and restore point creation.
                                            This may conserve disk space and system resources.

                                            However, disabling this task may leave your system more vulnerable to malware and reduce your ability
                                            to recover from system issues.

                                            This library is referred to by Microsoft as **Malware Protection Copy Accelerator Detours Dll** [1] [2] [3].
                                            It is a component of **Defender Antivirus** service [4].

                                            This component monitors and intercepts file copy operations, potentially blocking the copying of certain files [5] [6].
                                            It optimizes scanning by examining copied files for potential threats after a certain number of files have been transferred [7].

                                            The library uses Microsoft's **Detours** technology [3].
                                            This technology intercepts and monitors system functions [8].
                                            It allows **Defender Antivirus** to examine files during copying [3].

                                            Removing this library may improve privacy by reducing file operation monitoring.
                                            It may also enhance system performance during file copy operations.

                                            However, this action may reduce system security.
                                            Without this component, Defender may not scan files during copying, allowing malicious or unauthorized
                                            files to be copied undetected.

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > Disabling this feature may expose the system to security risks because it may prevent Defender from
                                            > monitoring and scanning files during copying.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            This script removes the library from the following locations:

                                            - `%PROGRAMFILES%\Windows Defender\MpDetoursCopyAccelerator.dll` [4] [6]

                                        name: Disable Defender Antivirus copy accelerator utility
                                        docs: |-
                                            This script disables the `MpCopyAccelerator.exe` process.

                                            This process is called the **Microsoft Malware Protection Copy Accelerator Utility** [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6].
                                            It is part of **Defender Antivirus** service [1] [2], introduced in update KB4052623, version 4.18.2201.10 update [3].

                                            It monitors and intercepts file copy operations to enhance security [3] [4] [5].

                                            It logs copy operations [4] and sends the data to Microsoft as part of its **Asimov** telemetry [4].
                                            **Asimov** is a Microsoft feedback mechanism that tracks user activity in real time [7].

                                            This script enhances privacy by disabling this process, preventing the logging of file copy operations
                                            and the transmission of telemetry data to Microsoft.

                                            Disabling this process may improve file operation performance by removing an extra layer of processing.

                                            However, disabling this utility may:

                                            - Reduce the ability of **Defender Antivirus** to monitor and protect against malware spread through file copying.
                                            - Affect the **Defender Antivirus**, potentially leaving your system more vulnerable to certain types of threats.

                                            > **Caution**: This script may decrease the security of your system, as it prevents **Defender Antivirus** from monitoring certain file copy operations.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            This script:

                                            - Terminates and blocks the execution of `MpCopyAccelerator.exe`
                                            - Removes `%PROGRAMFILES%\Windows Defender\MpCopyAccelerator.exe` [2].

                                            Historically, this file has been known to exist at
                                            `%PROGRAMDATA%\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\*\MpCopyAccelerator.exe` [1] [6]
                                            on older versions of Windows.

                                            Tests show that `MpCopyAccelerator.exe` is absent in Windows 10 versions 22H2 and later,
                                            but present in Windows 11 starting from version 23H2.

                                            `MpCopyAccelerator.exe` process works with `MsMpEng.exe` [5] and `MpDetourCopyAccelerator.dll` [3].
                                            It is injected into different processes by the `MpRtp.dll` module of `MsMpEng.exe` [3].

                                            Once injected, it intercepts file copy operations (specifically the `CopyFileExW` function) [3].
                                            When a file copy operation is detected, the actual file creation is handled by `MpCopyAccelerator.exe` instead of the original process [3].
                                            `MpCopyAccelerator.exe` runs as a child process of `MsMpEng.exe` (Windows Defender) [3].
                                            This mechanism is triggered after multiple rapid file copy operations (e.g., six times in 18 seconds) [3].

                                            Despite its name as an acceleration utility, its primary purpose is security monitoring of file copy operations [3].
                                            It uses **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** to communicate between processes [3] [4].
                                            It has multiple security checks to prevent unauthorized use or tampering [4].

                                            This script removes the `MpDetours.dll` library, effectively disabling its functionality.

                                            `MpDetours.dll` is called **Malware Protection Detours Dll** by Microsoft [1] [2].
                                            It is part of **Defender Antivirus** service [3] [4].
                                            It is a library designed to offer runtime protection and enforce security policies [4].
                                            The library monitors and controls system operations to prevent unauthorized access and data leaks [4].
                                            It achieves this by intercepting actions and enforcing security policies [4].

                                            It specifically monitors:

                                            - **Clipboard operations**:
                                              Controlling copy and paste activities to prevent unauthorized data transfers [4].
                                            - **Printing tasks**:
                                              Monitoring and controlling print jobs to prevent unauthorized outputs [4].
                                            - **Drag-and-drop actions**:
                                              Monitoring file movements to prevent data leaks [4].
                                            - **System components:**
                                              It employs techniques like DLL injection and API hooking, referred to as **Detours** [4].
                                              This technology allows intercepting and monitoring system functions [4] [5].

                                            It also:

                                            - Logs security-related events [4]
                                            - Implements security policies [4]
                                            - Manages processes and threads [4]

                                            This script enhances your privacy by stopping Windows from monitoring your clipboard content, print jobs,
                                            and file transfer activities.
                                            It may also lead to a minor improvement in system performance by reducing background monitoring processes.

                                            However, removing this component may decrease your system's security.
                                            Without it, your computer may be more vulnerable to data theft or unauthorized data sharing.
                                            This may also conflict with your organization's security policies, especially if you are using a work-managed device.

                                            > **Caution**: This action may increase your vulnerability to data breaches and malware infections.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            This script disables the file risk estimation library, `winshfhc.dll`.

                                            This library is a component of **Defender Antivirus** service [1] [2].
                                            It is officially named **File Risk Estimation** [3] [4] [5].

                                            It is responsible for:

                                            - Generalizing system imaging or deployment [2]
                                            - Logging system data [2]

                                            - Interacting with **Windows Security** [2]

                                            Disabling this library may enhance your privacy by reducing system data logging and
                                            limiting Defender's interactions with your system.

                                            This action may also improve boot performance by eliminating a component that runs during system startup.

                                            However, removing this library impairs functionality of **Defender Antivirus** and **Windows Security**.

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > This action may leave your system more vulnerable to malware and other security threats.
                                            > Consider having alternative security measures in place.

                            For enhanced security, users can require a VPN for all connections with IPSec rules [1] [3] [7].
                            This can protect your computer from unauthorized access [1] [4] [6] [8].

                            Microsoft has renamed the firewall several times to reflect branding changes:

                            1. **Internet Connection Firewall** initially [3].
                            2. **Windows Firewall** with the release of Windows XP Service Pack 2 [3].
                            3. **Windows Defender Firewall** starting with Windows 10 build 1709 (September 2017) [4] [5].
                            4. **Microsoft Defender Firewall** from Windows 10 version 2004 onwards [5] [6].
                            5. **Windows Firewall** again in 2023 [9].

                            Considerations:

                            - Malware or unauthorized users can bypass it if they gain direct access to the computer [10].
                            - Default firewall settings often provide limited security unless properly configured [10].
                              This is the case for most users.
                            - The firewall is enabled by default [1] [2] [4] [5].
                              It still operates in the background when turned off [7].
                              This can compromise privacy.
                            - Firewall logs detail user behavior [11].
                              They fall under [Microsoft's privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20231006103250/https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement).
                              This allows Microsoft to access and analyze these logs to study your behavior.

                            Turning off this firewall may optimize system performance by reducing background tasks [7].
                            It enhances privacy by preventing the collection of firewall logs [11].
                            However, this could increase security risks by exposing your system to more threats [1] [4] [6] [8].

                            > **Caution**:
                            > Turning off the Defender Firewall **may reduce your security**.
                            > Consider an alternative security solution to maintain protection.

                                category: Disable Defender Firewall services and drivers
                                docs: |-
                                    This section contains scripts to disable the essential services and drivers of Defender Firewall.

                                    Defender Firewall uses services and drivers to operate.
                                    Services run background tasks, while drivers help hardware and software communicate.

                                    Even with the firewall disabled in settings, its services and drivers continue running [1],
                                    potentially monitoring network traffic and consuming resources.
                                    These scripts directly disable these components, bypassing standard Windows settings and their limitations.

                                    Disabling these firewall services and drivers can enhance privacy by preventing potential network traffic monitoring by Microsoft.
                                    Additionally, it may improve system performance by freeing up system resources otherwise consumed by these components.

                                    However, this can pose security risks and disrupt other software.
                                    Defender Firewall blocks unauthorized network access to protect against malicious attacks [2].
                                    Disabling it can leave your system vulnerable to such threats.
                                    Additionally, this could affect software relying on the firewall [1].

                                    > **Caution**: These scripts **may reduce your security** and **cause issues with software** relying on the firewall [1].

                                            This script disables the **Windows Defender Firewall Authorization Driver** service.

                                            This service is a kernel mode driver crucial for inspecting network traffic entering and exiting your computer [1] [2].

                                            Disabling this service can enhance privacy by reducing Microsoft's capability to monitor and analyze your network traffic.
                                            It also improves system performance by decreasing background resource consumption.

                                            The driver is identified by the file `mpsdrv.sys` [1] [2] [3].
                                            This file is a component of **Microsoft Protection Service** [3].
                                            This service encompasses the **Windows Defender Firewall** (`mpssvc`) [4] [5].
                                            Disabling this driver disables **Windows Defender Firewall** [1] [2].
                                            This action can significantly increase security risks [6].

                                            Restart your computer after running this script to ensure all changes take effect [7].

                                            > **Caution**: Disabling this service causes problems with software that depends on it [8] such as:
                                            > - Prevents **Microsoft Store** app downloads [9] [10], impacting **winget** CLI functionality [11].
                                            > - Disables **`netsh advfirewall`** commands, used for Windows Firewall management [8].

                                            This script disables the **Windows Defender Firewall** service (identified as `MpsSvc` [1] [2] [3] [4]).
                                            This component acts as a gatekeeper for your computer, filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic based on
                                            established security rules [1] [5] to prevent unauthorized access [3] [4].

                                            This service runs the firewall component of Windows [4].
                                            It starts automatically [3] and runs the `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\MPSSVC.dll` driver [3].
                                            This file is also referred to as **Microsoft Protection Service** [6].

                                            Beyond firewall functionality, it plays an important role in **Windows Service Hardening** to protect Windows services
                                            [7] [8]. It also enforces **network isolation** in virtualized environments [7] [9].

                                            Disabling this service can enhance privacy by reducing Microsoft's capability to monitor and analyze your network traffic.
                                            It also improves system performance by decreasing background resource consumption.
                                            However, it may expose the system to substantial security threats [10].
                                            This risk is partly mitigated by boot-time filters that are triggered to protect the computer during startup or when the
                                            firewall service stops unexpectedly [2].

                                            Restart your computer after running this script to ensure all changes take effect [11].

                                            > **Caution**: Disabling this service causes problems with software that depends on it [12] such as:
                                            > - Prevents **Microsoft Store** app downloads (error code `0x80073D0A` [7] [13]), impacting **winget** CLI functionality [14].
                                            > - Disables **`netsh advfirewall`** commands, used for Windows Firewall management [15].
                                            > - Disables **Windows Sandbox** [11] [16], an isolated environment for safely running applications [17].
                                            > - Disables **Docker** [18], a platform for developing and running applications in isolated environments [19].
                                            > - Disables **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** [18], which lets Linux programs run directly on Windows [20].

                                        docs: |-
                                            This script disables the Microsoft Security WFP callout driver and its associated files.

                                            Microsoft refers to this component as **Microsoft Security WFP Callout Driver** [1].
                                            This is a kernel-mode driver [1].
                                            Windows uses this driver to monitor and control network traffic for security purposes [2].

                                            It is part of the **Windows Filtering Platform (WFP)**.
                                            **WFP** provides a framework for building network filtering applications [2].
                                            It is used by built-in **Defender Firewall** to filter network packets [2].
                                            It works on TCP/IP communication using **TCP/IP Protocol Driver** (`Tcpip`) [1].

                                            The driver is a **callout driver**.
                                            This means that it processes network data beyond simple filtering [3].
                                            It performs deep inspections, modifies packet or stream data, and logs network activity [3].
                                            This helps manage and enforce security policies for network traffic [4].

                                            Disabling this driver may enhance privacy by preventing the system from performing detailed network data inspections and logging.
                                            Additionally, the script may slightly boost system performance and shorten boot times by stopping the driver from loading at startup.

                                            On On modern Windows versions, this driver is either missing entirely or is stopped and set to **Manual** by default [1].
                                            This means it does not actively run unless specifically triggered.

                                            However, disabling this driver poses security risks:

                                            - **Reduced threat detection:**
                                              Your system may become more vulnerable to network-based attacks.
                                            - **Reduced firewall effectiveness:**
                                              The **Defender Firewall** may not work as effectively to monitor and block malicious network traffic.
                                            - **Potential system instability:**
                                              Other security features or applications that depend on this driver may not function properly.

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > Disabling this driver may reduce your system's network security.
                                            > Consider having alternative security measures in place.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            This script:

                                    This script hides the "Firewall & network protection" section in the "Windows Security" interface. Previously, this interface was
                                    called "Windows Defender Security Center" [1].

                                    The "Firewall & network protection" section provides details about the device's firewalls and network connections [2]. It shows the status
                                    of both the Windows Defender Firewall and any other third-party firewalls [2]. However, after using this script, users will no longer see
                                    this section in the "Windows Security" interface [3].

                                    This script sets the `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender Security Center\Firewall and network protection!UILockdown" registry
                                    key to hide the Firewall and network protection area [3].

                        docs: |-
                            This category provides scripts to disable Defender for Endpoint, a security platform that impacts
                            user privacy.

                            Defender for Endpoint is officially known as **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** [1] [2] [3].
                            It was previously called **Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)** [1] [4].
                            It is designed to protect enterprise networks from advanced threats [1] [3].

                            An **advanced threat**, also known as an **Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)**, is a type of cyber
                            attack that uses continuous, covert, and sophisticated methods to gain and maintain unauthorized
                            access to a system for an extended period [5].
                            These attacks usually target high-value entities such as nation states and large corporations [5].

                            Although designed for security, this service raises significant privacy concerns.
                            Microsoft collects and stores device details, including information about files, processes,
                            system configurations, and network connections [2].

                            Some components of Defender for Endpoint are included by default in consumer versions of Windows [4],
                            potentially exposing personal user data.

                            Disabling this service can enhance privacy by limiting data collection and sharing with Microsoft.
                            It may also improve system performance by reducing background processes and resource usage.
                            However, disabling this service may reduce your device's security against advanced threats.

                            > **Caution:**
                            > Disabling this service may reduce your device's security.
                            > Consider alternative protection methods and practice enhanced security awareness.

                                docs: |-
                                    This script disables the Microsoft Data Loss Prevention (DLP) service.

                                    The service is known by several names:

                                    - Microsoft Data Loss Prevention Service [1] [2] [3]
                                    - Microsoft Endpoint DLP service [2]
                                    - Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention Service [1]

                                    This service is a component of both **Defender Antivirus** and **Defender for Endpoint** [1].
                                    It is also included in the larger **Microsoft Purview** offering [1] [4].

                                    This service provides DLP (Data Loss Prevention) functionality [3] [5].
                                    It helps prevent unauthorized sharing of sensitive data [4].
                                    It tracks and controls sensitive data across Microsoft services, apps, and devices [4].
                                    DLP uses advanced content analysis to detect sensitive information based on organizational policies [4].
                                    Techniques include keyword matching, regular expressions, function validation, proximity analysis, and machine learning algorithms [4].

                                    This script enhances privacy by stopping data collection on your files and activities.
                                    It may also boost system performance by reducing background processes.

                                    However, disabling this service may reduce security by disabling organizational data protection mechanisms.
                                    On work or school computers, disabling this service may violate organizational policies and compliance requirements.

                                    > **Caution:** This script may lower security by disrupting organizational data protection mechanisms.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    The script performs the following actions:

                                    - Disables the `MDDlpSvc` service.
                                    - Deletes the `MpDlpService.exe` file.
                                    - Prevents the execution of `MpDlpService.exe`.

                                    The service is named `MDDlpSvc` [3] and is available on Windows 10 and 11 [3].
                                    This service runs the `MpDlpService.exe` process [1] [2] [3] [5].
                                    The process is located at:

                                    - `%PROGRAMFILES%\Windows Defender\MpDlpService.exe` for older Windows versions, such as Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019 [1].
                                    - `%PROGRAMDATA%\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\<version number>\MpDlpService.exe` for modern Windows versions.
                                      Tests confirm this path since Windows 10 Pro ≥ 22H2 and Windows 11 Pro ≥ 23H2.
  
                                    Historically, this functionality was part of the main Defender service [5].
                                    In 2024, Microsoft separated DLP into its own process [3] [5].

                                    Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is a security suite designed to protect devices from cyber threats [1].
                                    Some components are included by default on Windows without requiring user opt-in [2] [3].
                                    Remote configuration allows administrators to manage and update settings across multiple devices.
                                    This feature is typically used in work or school environments where centralized control of multiple devices
                                    is necessary.

                                    Disabling this feature enhances privacy by preventing remote changes to your Defender for Endpoint settings.
                                    It may also improve system performance by reducing background processes related to remote management.

                                    However, disabling this feature may:

                                    - Prevent automatic security updates from being applied.
                                    - Limit the ability of IT administrators to manage security settings across devices.
                                    - Violate your organization's compliance policies if you're on a work or school computer.

                                    > **Caution:**
                                    > Disabling this feature may reduce your device's security and limit automatic security adjustments.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    This script disables the following components:

                                    This script disables the `MpDlpCmd.exe` process.

                                    The executable `MpDlpCmd.exe` is the **Microsoft Endpoint DLP command-line utility** [1] [2] [3] [6].
                                    The process is part of **Defender Antivirus** [1] [5] [6] and **Defender for Endpoint** [2] [4].

                                    It offers Data Loss Prevention (DLP) features [6].
                                    DLP is designed to prevent unauthorized sharing or leakage of sensitive data [7].

                                    The utility:

                                    - Monitors and controls data sharing within an organization [9]
                                    - Blocks file operations and requires users to justify their actions based on security policies [5]
                                    - Logs user activity [5] and communicates with Microsoft servers [5] [8]

                                    This script improves your privacy by:

                                    - Preventing Microsoft from monitoring your file operations
                                    - Stopping automated data collection about your file usage
                                    - Reducing background network communication
                                    - Preventing logging of your data and actions

                                    This script may also enhance system performance by:

                                    - Removing a constantly running background process
                                    - Reducing system resource usage during file operations
                                    - Decreasing startup time

                                    If your organization relies on DLP policies, disabling this tool will reduce security by:

                                    - Sensitive data may be shared without oversight
                                    - Security policies for file handling may not be enforced
                                    - Data breach prevention capabilities may be limited

                                    > **Caution**: Disabling this feature may reduce protection against unauthorized data sharing and increase the risk of data leaks.

                                    ### Technical Details
                                        
                                    `MpDlpCmd.exe` is a command-line tool that may display dialogs or notifications [6].
                                    It is loaded by `SvcHost.exe` as a Windows service [9] and loads `MpClient.dll` [9].

                                    It is located at:

                                    - `%PROGRAMFILES%\Windows Defender\MpDlpCmd.exe` on Windows 10 or Windows Server 2019 and above [2] [5].
                                    - `%PROGRAMDATA%\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\*\MpDlpCmd.exe` on older versions of Windows [3]

                                    Tests show this file exists starting from Windows 11 version 23H2, but not on Windows 10 version 22H2 and later.

                                    This script disables `EndpointDlp.dll`, the endpoint data loss prevention (DLP) library.

                                    This library is part of **Defender Antivirus** [1] [2], and belongs to its service component [2].
                                    Microsoft refers to this library as **Microsoft Endpoint Data Leak Prevention Library** [3].

                                    It aims to prevent sensitive data from leaving an organization's network [4] [5] [6].
                                    It provides functions for process on Windows to monitor and control the flow of data [1] [4].
                                    It allows applications to notify the operating system before and after handling sensitive data [4].
                                    These functions are designed to protect sensitive information from accidental sharing or leaks [4] [5] [6].
                                    This feature is not enabled by default on Windows as it requires a specific license to use [1].

                                    Key functions of the DLP library include:

                                    - Monitoring file operations (opening, closing, saving) [1] [4]
                                    - Controlling clipboard and drag-and-drop actions [1] [4] [7]
                                    - Managing printing operations [1] [4] [7]
                                    - Enforcing cloud-based policies for files and applications [1] [4] [7]
                                    - Auditing and enforcing data protection rules [1] [4] [7]
                                    - Monitoring website and network interactions [1] [7]

                                    Disabling this library may enhance your privacy by preventing potential monitoring of activities related to sensitive data.
                                    It disables DLP features that track files, documents, user interactions, and associated Microsoft cloud data collection.

                                    It may also improve system performance by reducing background processes associated with data loss prevention.

                                    However, this script may reduce your security by disabling features designed to protect your sensitive data
                                    from unauthorized access or accidental sharing.

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > This action may expose you to risks such as accidental sharing or loss of sensitive data.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    This script removes the library from `%PROGRAMFILES%\Windows Defender\endpointdlp.dll` [2] [3].

                        docs: |- # refactor-with-variables: • SmartScreen Caution
                            This category focuses on disabling the SmartScreen and its features and components.

                            SmartScreen is known also as "Windows SmartScreen" [1], "Windows Defender SmartScreen" [2], "Microsoft Defender SmartScreen" [3],
                            "Phishing Filter" [4], and "SmartScreen Filter" [4].

                            It protects users from phishing attacks, malware websites, and potentially harmful downloads by assessing webpage safety and
                            comparing sites and downloads against lists of known threats [3].
                            However, it also sends URLs and file information to Microsoft servers [4], which raises significant privacy concerns.

                            Disabling SmartScreen through this category can enhance your privacy by stopping these data transmissions [5].
                            However, be aware that this action may compromise your security by removing the protections that SmartScreen provides
                            against malicious sites and downloads.

                            > **Caution**: Disabling SmartScreen may reduce your protection against phishing and malware.

                                category: Disable SmartScreen for apps and files
                                docs: |- # refactor-with-variables: • SmartScreen Caution
                                    This category includes scripts to disable SmartScreen for apps and files.

                                    SmartScreen is a security feature that checks the reputation of apps and files you download or run [1] [2].
                                    It's part of Windows' reputation-based protection system [1] [2] [3].

                                    Key points about SmartScreen for apps and files:

                                    - It blocks unrecognized apps and files that may be potentially harmful [2] [3].
                                    - It performs reputation checks on downloaded programs and their digital signatures [1].
                                    - If an app, file, or digital signature has an established good reputation, users don't see warnings [1].
                                    - Items without a reputation are flagged as higher risk, prompting a warning to the user [1].

                                    Disabling this feature can:

                                    - Enhance privacy by reducing data sent to Microsoft for reputation checks [4].
                                    - Improve system performance by eliminating background scanning and processing.
                                    - Give users more freedom to run apps and files without interference.

                                    However, disabling SmartScreen may also:

                                    - Reduce protection against malware, potentially harmful applications, and suspicious files.
                                    - Increase the risk of running malicious software unknowingly.

                                    > **Caution**: Disabling SmartScreen may reduce your protection against phishing and malware.

                                        name: Disable SmartScreen checks for apps and files
                                        docs: |- # refactor-with-variables: • SmartScreen Caution
                                            This script disables the SmartScreen checks for apps and files.

                                            SmartScreen protects users by warning them before running potentially malicious programs downloaded from the internet [1].
                                            This warning appears as a dialog box before you run an unrecognized or known malicious app downloaded from the internet [1].
                                            These checks are part of SmartScreen's *reputation-based protection* [2].
                                            This feature is enabled by default [1].
                                            Microsoft collects data about the files and programs you run when this feature is enabled [1] [3].

                                            This script stops SmartScreen from alerting you about potentially malicious apps and files [1] [2] [4] [5].
                                            It enhances privacy by stopping data collection required for SmartScreen checks.
                                            Microsoft suggests disabling it to manage connections and protect your privacy [6].
                                            The CIS Center for Internet Security mentions the potential privacy impact of keeping this feature enabled due to Microsoft data collection [3].
                                            This script also boosts system performance by reducing the overhead of SmartScreen checks.
                                            This gives users more freedom to choose applications and download files.

                                            However, this change may increase the risk of downloading harmful apps and files by reducing safety checks.
                                            Authorities like DISA [7] and the CIS Center for Internet Security [3] recommend keeping it enabled as a security measure.

                                            This script configures the following registry keys:

                                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer!SmartScreenEnabled` [4] [5] [8]:
                                              This action simulates the action of turning off SmartScreen via the Windows user interface to change user settings [4] [5].
                                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System!EnableSmartScreen` [1] [3] [6] [7] [9]:
                                              Sets Group Policy Object (GPO) to enforce this setting and prevent users from changing it [1].

                                            > **Caution**: Disabling SmartScreen may reduce your protection against phishing and malware.

                                            This script disables SmartScreen app blocking, allowing apps to bypass its warnings.

                                            SmartScreen is a security feature that protects users by displaying warnings before running potentially harmful programs [1] [2]  [3] [4].
                                            These warnings help prevent the execution of suspicious applications [1] [2].
                                            This feature is enabled by default on Windows [1].

                                            SmartScreen sends data to Microsoft about the files and applications run on the system [1] [3].
                                            This raises privacy concerns because it involves collecting user behavior data.
                                            The Center for Internet Security (CIS) mentions disabling it for additional privacy [3].
                                            Disabling SmartScreen can improve system performance by reducing the processing overhead.

                                            However, this may decrease system security by reducing protection against malicious software and phishing attacks.
                                            Authorities like DISA [4] and CIS [3] recommend keeping SmartScreen enabled and blocking suspicious apps as a security best practice.

                                            SmartScreen has two configurations:

                                            - **Warn and prevent bypass:**
                                              The user cannot ignore the warnings, and SmartScreen will repeat the warnings for subsequent attempts to run the app [1] [2].
                                            - **Warn:**
                                              SmartScreen initially warns the user about a suspicious app but allows the user to override the warning and run the app [1] [2].
                                              It will not issue further warnings for that app if the user chooses to proceed [1] [2].

                                            This script modifies the `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System!ShellSmartScreenLevel` registry key to enable bypass
                                            through the **Warn** option [1] [2] [3].

                                            > **Caution**: Disabling SmartScreen may reduce your protection against phishing and malware.

                                        category: Disable SmartScreen for Store apps
                                        docs: |- # refactor-with-variables: • SmartScreen Caution
                                            This category includes scripts to disable SmartScreen for Microsoft Store apps.

                                            SmartScreen for Microsoft Store apps is a security feature that:

                                            - Checks content used by Microsoft Store apps [1].
                                            - Can restrict app installations to only those from the Microsoft Store [2].
                                            - Scans web content (URLs) accessed by Microsoft Store apps [1] [3].

                                            It's part of Windows' broader **Reputation-based protection** system [1].

                                            Disabling this feature can:

                                            - Enhance privacy by reducing data sent to Microsoft for content and app checks [3].
                                            - Improve system performance by eliminating background scanning and processing.
                                            - Give users more freedom to install and run apps from various sources without interference [2].

                                            However, disabling SmartScreen for Store apps may also:

                                            - Reduce protection against malware and potentially harmful applications.
                                            - Increase the risk of running malicious software unknowingly.
                                            - Allow Microsoft Store apps to access potentially dangerous web content without warning.

                                            This category provides options to customize various aspects of SmartScreen's behavior for Store apps, balancing 
                                            between security, privacy, and user freedom.

                                            > **Caution**: Disabling SmartScreen may reduce your protection against phishing and malware.

                                                    This script disables the "App Install Control" feature of SmartScreen.

                                                    This feature restricts app installations exclusively to those from the Microsoft Store [1] [2].
                                                    It displays "The app you're trying to install isn't a Microsoft-verified app" message
                                                    during app installation [3].
                                                    By default, this feature is turned off [1] [2].
                                                    Disabling SmartScreen automatically deactivates it as well [1] [2].
                                                    This script explicitly deactivates the feature to guarantee it remains disabled.
                                                    Once disabled, SmartScreen permits users to install apps from any source, including the Internet [1] [2].

                                                    Disabling this feature enhances your privacy by limiting the data transmitted about your activities and behavior [4].
                                                    It also improves system performance by removing the need for continuous monitoring and evaluation of app sources,
                                                    which can reduce CPU and memory usage.
                                                    However, this also introduces a security risk by potentially permitting the installation of malicious apps.

                                                    The script specifically modifies the following registry keys to enforce these settings:

                                                    - `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\SmartScreen!ConfigureAppInstallControlEnabled` [1] [2] [4]
                                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\SmartScreen!ConfigureAppInstallControl` [4] [5]
                                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer!AicEnabled` [3] [5] [6] [7]

                                                    This script disables the web content checking feature of SmartScreen for Microsoft Store apps.

                                                    SmartScreen scans web content (URLs) accessed by Microsoft Store apps to enhance security [1] [2].
                                                    SmartScreen is enabled by default [2].
                                                    Initially, this feature was known as *SmartScreen Filter* for Microsoft Store apps [3].
                                                    Later, it was renamed to "SmartScreen for Microsoft Store apps" [2].
                                                    It is part of SmartScreen's reputation-based protection [2] [3] [4].

                                                    Disabling this feature enhances your privacy by reducing data shared with Microsoft.
                                                    Microsoft acknowledges that turning off this feature limits the data transmitted about your activities and behavior [1].
                                                    It can also improve system performance by reducing web content processing overhead.

                                                    However, there is a trade-off between privacy and security:

                                                    - Increased Privacy: Less data shared with Microsoft.
                                                    - Decreased Security: Less protection against phishing and malware.

                                                    The Polish Government advises turning this feature off to prioritize privacy over security [5].

                                                    This script modifies the following Windows registry keys:

                                                    - `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppHost!EnableWebContentEvaluation`: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
                                                    This key modifies the user interface setting [1] [3].
                                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppHost!EnableWebContentEvaluation` [4] [6] [7]
                                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppHost!EnableWebContentEvaluation` [3] [6]

                                                    > **Caution**: Disabling SmartScreen may reduce your protection against phishing and malware.

                                                name: Enable SmartScreen warning dismissal for Store apps

                                                    This script allows users to bypass SmartScreen warnings for Microsoft Store apps.

                                                    SmartScreen is a security feature that filters web content accessed by Microsoft Store apps [1] [2].
                                                    By default, SmartScreen allows users to bypass its warnings [1] [3].
                                                    This script keeps the default setting.

                                                    Enabling SmartScreen bypass may enhance privacy by reducing data shared with Microsoft.
                                                    It increases user control over security checks and may improve system
                                                    performance by removing an additional security check.
                                                    However, this reduces protection against malicious content, potentially exposing users to security risks.

                                                    ### Technical Details

                                                    This script modifies these Windows registry keys:

                                                    - `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppHost!PreventOverride` [1] [2] [4] [5]
                                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppHost!PreventOverride` [4] [5]

                                                    These keys, although not officially documented, interact with the SmartScreen executable (`smartscreen.exe`) [3].
                                                    Community reports confirm their role in controlling SmartScreen for Store apps [1] [2] [4].
                                                    Setting `PreventOverride` to `0` allows users to bypass SmartScreen warnings [3].

                                                    > **Caution**: Disabling SmartScreen may reduce your protection against phishing and malware.

                                category: Disable SmartScreen in Microsoft browsers
                                docs: |- # refactor-with-variables: • SmartScreen Caution
                                    This category provides scripts to disable SmartScreen in Microsoft browsers.

                                    SmartScreen is a security feature in Edge.
                                    When you visit websites or download files, SmartScreen checks the reputation of the URL or file [1].
                                    If SmartScreen determines that the site or file is malicious, it blocks access or download [1].
                                    SmartScreen is enabled by default in Microsoft Edge [1].

                                    SmartScreen feature raises privacy concerns because it sends unhashed URLs, downloaded files, applications being run, IP addresses,
                                    and the user's Security Identifier (SID) to Microsoft [1] [2] [3].

                                    This data transmission can potentially allow the company to track browsing history and user activities.                                   
                                    The transmission of full file paths and download URLs can expose a significant amount of sensitive and private information about a
                                    user's system and network structure.
                                    The combination of these data points could enable Microsoft to build a comprehensive profile of user activities and behavior.

                                    > **Caution**: Disabling SmartScreen may reduce your protection against phishing and malware.

                                            This script disables the SmartScreen feature in Edge.

                                            SmartScreen warns against potential phishing scams and malicious software [1] [2] [3].
                                            By default, Microsoft Defender SmartScreen is active, but users can opt out [1] [2].

                                            Once you run this script, Microsoft Defender SmartScreen will be turned off [1] [2].

                                            Disabling this feature reduces potential privacy risks by preventing data sharing.
                                            This may also improve system performance by reducing processing workload.

                                            While disabling this feature increases user autonomy and privacy, it may reduce your security.
                                            Authorities like DISA [2] and the CIS Center for Internet Security [3] discourage disabling it as a security best practice.
                                            Disabling may allow access to potentially malicious websites and software [2] [3].

                                            This script applies only to Windows devices within a Microsoft Active Directory domain or managed in similar way [1] [2].
                                            It is effective only on computers under organizational management, such as those in workplaces or schools.
                                            It's not applicable to personal computers that are not managed by an organization.

                                            Changing this policy does not require restarting the browser to take effect [1].
                                            This script configures the `SmartScreenEnabled` policy [1] [2] [3].

                                            This script disables Edge's SmartScreen feature that targets potentially unwanted applications (PUAs).

                                            Edge's SmartScreen PUA feature aims to protect against adware, coin miners, bundleware, and other
                                            low-reputation software [1] [2] [3].
                                            This feature warns users about potentially harmful applications [1] [2] [3].

                                            This feature is off by default [2].
                                            This script keeps the feature inactive, preventing automatic or unintended activations.

                                            Disabling this feature reduces potential privacy risks by preventing data sharing.
                                            This may also improve system performance by reducing processing workload.

                                            However, enabling it can boost your security by blocking the installation of apps that could harm your system [3].
                                            Authorities like DISA [2] and the CIS Center for Internet Security [3] encourage
                                            enabling it as a security best practice.

                                            This script allows users to bypass SmartScreen warnings in Edge.

                                            Edge's SmartScreen shows warnings about potentially malicious websites [1] [2] [3].
                                            By default [1] [2], users can override SmartScreen warnings and visit the site [1].
                                            This script maintains this option, enhancing privacy by minimizing data sent to Microsoft.

                                            Maintaining this option in its default state reduces potential privacy risks by limiting data sharing with Microsoft.
                                            This may also improve system performance by reducing processing workload.

                                            While keeping this setting disabled may increase user autonomy and privacy, it may reduce security
                                            by allowing access to potentially malicious websites [2] [3].
                                            Authorities like CIS Center for Internet Security [2] and DISA [3] recommend enabling it as a security best practice.

                                            By default, users can bypass Microsoft Defender SmartScreen warnings and complete unverified downloads [1] [2].
                                            This script maintains the default option, enabling users to bypass SmartScreen warnings if chosen.

                                            This script allows users to override these warnings.
                                            This enhances user privacy by reducing the amount of data sent to Microsoft for file scanning.
                                            However, this may reduce security as it allows the completion of potentially harmful, unverified downloads.
                                            Restricting downloads to verified sources significantly lowers the risk of acquiring viruses, spyware, or other malicious software [3].
                                            Authorities like The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) [2] and The Center of Internet Security (CIS) [3] advise
                                            against bypassing SmartScreen due to security concerns.

                                            This script applies only to Windows devices within a Microsoft Active Directory domain or managed in similar way [1].
                                            It is effective only on computers under organizational management, such as those in workplaces or schools.
                                            It's not applicable to personal computers that are not managed by an organization.

                                            This script configures the `PreventSmartScreenPromptOverrideForFiles` policy [1] [2] [3].
                                            Changing this policy does not require restarting the browser to take effect [1].

                                            This script stops Microsoft Defender SmartScreen from making DNS requests.

                                            By default [1] [2], Microsoft Defender SmartScreen sends DNS requests [1] [2] to identify
                                            potentially harmful websites, like those involved in phishing or malware [2] [3].
                                            
                                            Disabling DNS requests stops SmartScreen from obtaining IP addresses [1] [2],
                                            which enhances privacy by reducing IP data sharing.
                                            This script also improves security by reducing dependence on DNS servers.
                                            Disabling DNS requests mitigates a security risk: if DNS fails to resolve a website,
                                            the browser cannot isolate it through Web Isolation [2] [3].
                                            The Center for Internet Security (CIS) recommends this action for its security benefits [2].
                                            Additionally, disabling DNS requests can improve system performance by reducing processing workload.
                                            However, this change may reduce IP-based protections [1] [2], posing a security trade-off.

                                            This script applies only to Windows devices within a Microsoft Active Directory domain or managed in similar way [2] [3].

                                            This script lets you configure whether Microsoft Defender SmartScreen checks download reputation from a trusted source [1].

                                            Edge determines a trusted source by checking its Internet zone [1].
                                            If the source comes from the local system, intranet, or trusted sites zone, then the download
                                            is considered trusted and safe [1].

                                            By default, if you do not run this script, Microsoft Defender SmartScreen checks the download's reputation regardless of source [1].
                                            Once you run this script, Microsoft Defender SmartScreen doesn't check the download's reputation when downloading from a trusted source [1].
                                            This increases your privacy by removing the need to send data to Microsoft about downloaded files.
                                            It can also increase your performance by removing the processing need for the check.
                                            However, it may reduce your security against malicious software [2].
                                            CIS (Center of Internet Security) discourage this script and recommend allowing the checks [2].
                                            This increases security because SmartScreen can verify that downloads are from a trusted source will
                                            downloading an infected package to their machine [2].

                                            This script applies only to Windows devices within a Microsoft Active Directory domain or managed in similar way [1].

                                            This script prevents specific versions of Microsoft Edge from updating to the newer SmartScreen library.
                                              
                                            This script reverts Microsoft Edge to the previous SmartScreen library, used before version 103 [1] [2].
                                            It blocks Edge from loading the new SmartScreen library (`libSmartScreenN`),
                                            which is responsible for checking site URLs and application downloads [1].
                                            By running this script, Edge will utilize the older library (`libSmartScreen`).

                                            This script is effective only for Microsoft Edge versions 95 to 107 [1].
                                            It does not function on versions older than 95, which always use the older library [1].
                                            Similarly, versions newer than 107 always utilize the newer library [1] [2].

                                            Disabling the updated SmartScreen library can increase privacy by limiting data collection but may reduce
                                            security as it bypasses the latest updates that combat phishing and malware.
                                            
                                            This script may improve system performance since some users have reported slowdowns with the new
                                            library [3]; these issues have probably already been resolved as the library has matured.

                                            This script applies only to Windows devices within a Microsoft Active Directory domain or managed in similar way [2] [3].

                                            Edge (Legacy) uses the Windows Defender SmartScreen by default to protect users from phishing scams and malicious software [1] [2].
                                            This feature is enabled by default and cannot be turned off by users [2].

                                            This script disables SmartScreen and prevents users from turning it back on [2].
                                            As a result, users will not receive alerts about potential threats [2].

                                            Disabling this feature reduces potential privacy risks by preventing data sharing.
                                            This may also improve system performance by reducing processing workload.

                                            While enabling this setting may increase user autonomy and privacy, it reduces security [1].
                                            Users should be cautious and understand the risks involved.

                                            This script configures the `EnabledV9` policy [1] [2] [3].
                                            This script only applies to Edge (Legacy) and does not impact newer versions of Edge.

                                            Edge (Legacy) features a SmartScreen filter that warns users about potentially malicious websites and file downloads [1].
                                            By default, this feature allows users to ignore these warnings and proceed to download files [1].
                                            This script keeps this option, enhancing user privacy by minimizing data sent to Microsoft.

                                            Disabling this feature reduces potential privacy risks by preventing data sharing.

                                        docs: |- # refactor-with-variables: • SmartScreen Caution
                                            This script disables SmartScreen in outdated versions of Internet Explorer.

                                            SmartScreen is also known as the *Phishing Filter* [1] [2] or *SmartScreen Filter* [2] [3].
                                            It protects users by identifying and blocking malicious web content [2] [3].

                                            Disabling this feature enhances your privacy by preventing the collection of data related to your browsing habits.
                                            It can also increase system performance by reducing the computational overhead required to scan and evaluate web content.
                                            However, this may also lower your security, as it makes the browser more vulnerable to malicious sites and downloads [3].

                                            Internet Explorer is no longer supported and has been replaced by Microsoft Edge on recent versions of Windows [1].
                                            However, this script remains relevant for older versions where Internet Explorer is still operational.

                                            The script modifies the `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Zones\<ZoneNumber>\2301` registry key [1] [2] [3].
                                            Each zone in the registry represents a different security level [1]:

                                            | Security Zone | Meaning                 |
                                            |---------------|-------------------------|
                                            | `0`           | My Computer             |
                                            | `1`           | Local Intranet Zone     |
                                            | `2`           | Trusted Sites Zone      |
                                            | `3`           | Internet Zone           |
                                            | `4`           | Restricted Sites Zone   |

                                            Disabling SmartScreen is achieved by setting the value of `2301` to `3` [2].

                                            Despite the official end of support for Internet Explorer 11 on June 15, 2022 [4],
                                            some systems may still have this component.

                                            Benefits:

                                            - **Privacy improvement**:
                                               By disabling the SmartScreen functionality that monitors user behavior,
                                              this script enhances your privacy.
                                            - **Security enhancement**:
                                              It reduces the attack surface by removing unused components, aligning with
                                              security best practices.
                                            - **System performance**:
                                              It may improve system performance by removing unnecessary components.

                                            Trade-offs:

                                            - **Reduced security**:
                                              The absence of SmartScreen may decrease protection against malware and phishing.
                                            - **Browser Functionality**:
                                              If Internet Explorer is still in use, disabling the SmartScreen filter
                                              may lead to errors, particularly with security features like phishing protection.
                                            - **System stability**:
                                              Internet Explorer components are integrated into Windows.
                                              Some Windows features and third-party applications may depend on these components.
                                              Removing the `ieapfltr.dll` file may lead to stability issues in applications that depend
                                              on it, even if Internet Explorer is not actively used.

                                            > **Caution**: Disabling SmartScreen may reduce your protection against phishing and malware.

                                    This category includes scripts that disable SmartScreen system components.

                                    SmartScreen is a security feature in Windows that helps protect your device from 
                                    potentially harmful applications, files, and websites [1].
                                    Its components run in the background as part of the operating system.

                                    Disabling these components may:

                                    - Improve privacy by reducing data collection used for SmartScreen functionality [2].
                                    - Increase system performance by eliminating background processes.
                                    - Enhance security by removing potential attack surfaces.

                                    However, there are risks to consider:

                                    - Reduced protection against malicious software and phishing attempts.
                                    - Potential impact on Windows system integrity.

                                    These scripts modify core system components.
                                    Consider your personal risk tolerance and needs before applying these changes.

                                    > **Caution**: Disabling SmartScreen may reduce your protection against phishing and malware.

                                            This script stops the `smartscreen.exe` process and prevents it from running.

                                            This process is officially known as *Windows Defender SmartScreen* [1] [2].
                                            It manages the SmartScreen functionality [3] [4].
                                            Disabling SmartScreen enhances privacy by preventing outbound network connections that transmit your data [5].
                                            Even when disabled, SmartScreen continues running in the background [3].
                                            It also improves system performance by reducing CPU usage [6].

                                            However, disabling the SmartScreen process may compromise your security by removing its protective features.
                                            Additionally, if SmartScreen remains partially enabled after the process is disabled,
                                            it may impair the functionality of Microsoft Store apps [3] [5] [7].

                                        name: Disable SmartScreen libraries
                                        docs: |-
                                            This script disables essential SmartScreen libraries, limiting their functionality and preventing
                                            their use by other programs.

                                            A *library* is a set of code and resources that help programs operate.
                                            A *DLL (Dynamic Link Library)* contains code and data that multiple programs can use simultaneously.

                                            Disabling these libraries stops SmartScreen operations across applications.
                                            This enhances your privacy by eliminating SmartScreen data collection.
                                            It improves security by reducing the system's attack surface.
                                            It may also improve system performance by freeing up system resources.

                                            However, turning off these libraries may lower your system's defenses against malware and phishing,
                                            as it stops the identification and blocking of potentially unsafe content.

                                            This script targets and disables the following specific SmartScreen libraries critical to their operations:

                                            - `smartscreen.dll`:
                                                This DLL enables core SmartScreen functionality [1].
                                                It manages essential SmartScreen tasks, such as performing security checks and evaluating the
                                                safety and reputation of files, applications, and web content [2] [3].
                                            - `smartscreenps.dll`:
                                                This DLL supports SmartScreen functionality [4].
                                                It facilitates SmartScreen's critical functions, including component management, registration, and
                                                lifecycle within a COM framework [5] [6].

                                            This script disables COM SmartScreen integrations within Windows.

                                            **SmartScreen** is a security feature that aims to protect your device from harmful applications,
                                            files, and websites by comparing items with a database of known threats [1].

                                            **COM (Component Object Model)** objects are software components that let different programs communicate [2].
                                            These integrations allow SmartScreen to interact with various Windows components [2] [3].
                                            Disabling these components disrupts SmartScreen's functionality.

                                            This script improves privacy by:

                                            - Reducing data collection related to SmartScreen operations
                                            - Limiting the system's ability to scan and report on your activities

                                            Disabling SmartScreen may improve system performance by:

                                            - Removing background processes associated with SmartScreen
                                            - Potentially speeding up application launches, especially if SmartScreen is partially disabled [4]

                                            If other SmartScreen components are already disabled, this script may help maintain system integrity [4].

                                            However, disabling these integrations may reduce security by:

                                            - Limiting the system's ability to detect and prevent malware or phishing attempts [1]
                                            - Disabling protective features that scan downloaded files and warn about unsafe websites [1]

                                            > Disabling SmartScreen integrations may make your system more vulnerable to malware and phishing attacks.
                                            > Consider your personal security needs before applying these changes.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            This script disables several COM interfaces, classes, and applications associated with SmartScreen.

                                            Key components affected include:

                                            - SmartScreen event logging and reporting interfaces
                                            - URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and file reputation services
                                            - Application reputation services
                                            - SmartScreen-related Windows Runtime activatable classes

                                            The components disabled by this script consist of:

                                category: Disable SmartScreen Enhanced Phishing Protection
                                docs: |-
                                    This category contains scripts to disable SmartScreen's **Enhanced Phishing Protection** feature,
                                    which monitors password usage and sends data to Microsoft.

                                    This feature collects information from suspicious websites or apps to identify security threats when users enter their passwords [1].
                                    It was introduced in Windows 11, version 22H2 [1] [2], and is technically identified as `webthreatdefense` (Web Threat Defense) [2].

                                    This feature raises several privacy concerns, including:

                                    - Monitoring of password entries across various applications and websites [1] [2]
                                    - Collection of additional data in suspicious scenarios, including displayed content, played sounds, and application memory [1] [2]
                                    - Transmission of telemetry data to Microsoft [1] [2]
                                    - Potential sharing of data with organizational IT departments via **Intune** and **Defender for Endpoint** [1]
                                    - Tracking of password reuse across different services [1] [2]
                                    - Monitoring of password input in common applications like Notepad, Word, OneNote, or Excel [2], and other office apps [1]

                                    Disabling these features enhances privacy by:

                                    - Reducing the sensitive data collected and shared with Microsoft.
                                    - Limiting the monitoring of password usage across applications.
                                    - Decreasing the telemetry sent from your device.

                                    It may also improve system performance by reducing background monitoring activities.

                                    However, disabling **Enhanced Phishing Protection** may reduce your security
                                    by removing alerts that help protect against phishing attacks and unsafe password practices.

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > Disabling this feature means you will not receive warnings about potential phishing attacks
                                    > or unsafe password usage, which may increase your vulnerability.

                                        docs: |-
                                            This script disables the `webthreatdefsvc` and `webthreatdefusersvc` services.

                                            These services enhance security by monitoring for unauthorized access to user credentials [1] [2] [3].
                                            However, these services also collect telemetry [4] [5] and sensor data [5], raising privacy concerns.
                                            Disabling these services reduces this data collection, thereby enhancing privacy.

                                            Additionally, these services require opening firewall ports [6] and running background services [6],
                                            which may increase your attack surface and reduce security.

                                            Disabling these services may also improve system performance by reducing background activity.

                                            However, disabling these services may reduce protection against some web threats.

                                            > **Caution:** Disabling this service may reduce your defense against certain web threats.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            This script disables the related services, their files and COM registrations.

                                            #### Services Overview

                                            | Service | Service Name | Service File |
                                            | ------- | ------------ | ------------ |
                                            | `webthreatdefsvc` | Web Threat Defense Endpoint Service [1] | `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\webthreatdefsvc.dll` [1] [6] |
                                            | `webthreatdefusersvc` | Web Threat Defense User Service [2] [3] | `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\webthreatdefusersvc.dll` [2] |

                                            Both services send data to Microsoft, including telemetry data from `MicrosoftTelemetryAssertTriggeredUM` [4] [5]
                                            and sensor data `Office App Sensor` [5].

                                            These services are associated with  the **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** suite.
                                            This program was formerly known as **Windows Advanced Threat Protection** [7].
                                            They read settings from `Software\Microsoft\Windows Advanced Threat Protection` [4].
                                            These settings manage **Defender for Endpoint** [8].

                                            These services are linked to **SmartScreen Enhanced Phishing Protection** because:

                                            - They access configurations under `Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WTDS\Components` [4], which
                                              are specific to SmartScreen Enhanced Phishing Protection [9].
                                            - They are named Web Threat Defense, and SmartScreen Enhanced Phishing Protection is technically
                                              named `WebThreatDefense` [9].

                                            They are available on Windows 11 22H2 and later but are missing on earlier Windows versions [1] [2],
                                            including Windows 10.

                                            #### Services Files

                                            - `webthreatdefsvc.dll` manages web threats using threat intelligence (via `ThreatIntelligence.dll`)
                                              and interfaces with system resources [4] [10].
                                            - `webthreatdefusersvc.dll` provides threat detection and management at the user level,

                                            users enter work or school passwords on potentially malicious sites or apps [2].

                                            This script improves privacy by stopping the collection of potentially sensitive user data.
                                            It may also slightly boost system performance by reducing background data collection.

                                            However, disabling this feature may weaken phishing protection.
                                            Organizations like the Center for Internet Security (CIS) recommend keeping this setting enabled for stronger security [1].

                                            > **Caution:**
                                            > Disabling this feature may increase vulnerability to advanced phishing attacks targeting work or school credentials.

                                            This script disables the **Enhanced Phishing Protection** warnings in Defender SmartScreen related to potentially
                                            malicious password entry scenarios.

                                            By default, these warnings are turned off [1].
                                            This script ensures it remains disabled.
                                            Disabling this feature stops warnings from appearing when users enter their work or school passwords
                                            into potentially malicious websites or applications [1].

                                            This option is also known as **Warn me about malicious apps and sites** [2].
                                            It warns users when they enter their work or school password into potentially malicious situations [1] [3].
                                            These scenarios include:

                                            - Reported phishing sites [1] [3]
                                            - Microsoft login URLs with invalid certificates [1] [3]
                                            - Applications connecting to either of the above [1] [3]

                                            It displays a pop-up notification when users try to access a website blocked by **Defender SmartScreen** [3].
                                            It helps users understand why a website is blocked and decide whether to proceed [3].

                                            This script enhances privacy by reducing the data sent to Microsoft.
                                            It may also improve system performance through reduced resource usage, fewer notifications, and less network activity.
                                            
                                            However, this script may decrease security.
                                            The Center for Internet Security (CIS) recommends enabling this feature for better protection against phishing attacks [3].

                                            > **Caution**: Disabling this feature may expose you to phishing attacks and other online threats without warning.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            This script applies only to Microsoft Accounts [3].
                                            It is only supported on Microsoft Windows 11 and later versions [1] [3].
                                            It does not affect on-premises domain-joined accounts [3].

                                            This script sets the `NotifyMalicious` [1] [2] [4] policy to disabled state.

                                            This script disables the **Warn me about password reuse** feature in Defender SmartScreen's **Enhanced Phishing Protection**.

                                            The script prevents SmartScreen from warning users when they reuse their work or school password across different services [1] [2].
                                            The feature aims to encourage users to change reused passwords [1].

                                            This feature is off by default [1].
                                            By explicitly disabling it, the script ensures it remains inactive persistently.

                                            This script improves privacy by reducing the password-related data shared with Microsoft.
                                            It may also improve system performance by eliminating the background processes that check for password reuse.
                                            This feature may occasionally misidentify password reuse [2], potentially causing user inconvenience.

                                            However, disabling this feature may reduce security.
                                            The Center for Internet Security (CIS) recommends keeping it enabled for stronger security [2].
                                            When active, this feature alerts users if they try to use a password that has been exposed in a known data breach [2].
                                            This can help reduce the risk of unauthorized access to online accounts and encourage the use of strong, unique passwords [2].

                                            > **Caution**: Disabling this feature means you won't receive warnings about potentially compromised passwords,
                                            > which may increase your risk of using unsafe passwords.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            This script sets the `NotifyPasswordReuse` [1] [3] [4] policy to disabled state.

                                            This script disables Enhanced Phishing Protection in Microsoft Defender SmartScreen on Windows.

                                            Enhanced Phishing Protection monitors and captures unsafe password entries, sending telemetry data to
                                            Microsoft Defender [1] [2].
                                            In audit mode, users are not notified about potential security risks [1] [2].

                                            Running this script fully disables Enhanced Phishing Protection [1].
                                            It will no longer capture events, send telemetry, or notify users [1].
                                            Users will not be able to re-enable it through the graphical interface [1].

                                            This script enhances privacy by preventing the collection and transmission of user data related to password entry events.
                                            It may also improve system performance by reducing background processes and data transmission.

                                            However, disabling this feature may reduce your protection against phishing attempts.
                                            The Center for Internet Security (CIS) recommends keeping this feature enabled for better security [2].

                                            > Disabling Enhanced Phishing Protection may leave you more vulnerable to phishing attacks.
                                            > You will not be able to re-enable this feature without reverting the script's changes.

                                            This script disables the user interface for Enhanced Phishing Protection on Windows.

                                            Enhanced Phishing Protection is a feature in Windows 11 that aims to protect users
                                            from phishing attacks [1].
                                            This feature monitors the passwords you enter and warns you if a site may be malicious [1].

                                            This script prevents Enhanced Phishing Protection from displaying warnings and prompts.
                                            It does not stop the underlying monitoring but disables only the visual warnings and prompts.

                                            This may enhance privacy perception by reducing monitoring notifications, though background
                                            monitoring continues.
                                            It may slightly improve system performance by disabling these UI elements.
                                            However, you will not receive warnings about potential phishing attempts, increasing your
                                            risk of falling victim to such attacks.
                                            
                                            > **Caution**: This action reduces your ability to detect phishing attempts.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            This feature is unavailable on Windows 10 and Windows 11 21H2 [1].
                                            It is enabled by default on Windows 11 [3] (confirmed by tests on version 23H2 and later).

                                            Enhanced Phishing Protection collects data on phishing attacks to improve Microsoft's security products [1].
                                            It shares this data across Microsoft's security suite, including Microsoft Defender for Endpoint [1].

                                            This feature allows organizations to monitor unsafe password usage through alerts and reports in
                                            the Microsoft 365 Defender Portal [1].

                                            This script enhances your privacy by:

                                            - Preventing data collection and sharing related to your online activities.
                                            - Reducing the data collected by Microsoft and potentially your organization regarding your browsing habits.

                                            However, disabling this feature may:

                                            - Reduce the effectiveness of Microsoft's phishing protection.
                                            - Limit your organization's ability to detect and respond to phishing threats.

                                            > **Caution**:

                                    The `SmartScreenSettings.exe` is a user interface component [1] [2] that displays settings
                                    for the SmartScreen filter [3] [4].

                                    Removing this component may enhance privacy by eliminating the possibility to modify
                                    SmartScreen settings, which could otherwise be used to re-enable this monitoring feature [3] [4].
                                    It also optimizes system performance by removing this obsolete component.

                                    However, disabling this feature could reduce security by limiting your system's protection against
                                    phishing and malware.

                                    It is located at the following paths:

                        docs: |-
                            This category offers scripts to disable or modify different aspects of the **Windows Security** user interface,
                            formerly known as **Windows Defender Security Center**.
                            
                            **Windows Security** is a centralized interface managing various Windows security features [1] [2] [3] [4].
                            It evolved from **Windows Defender**, initially a standalone antivirus with its own interface [5].
                            Over time, Microsoft separated the management interface from the core antivirus component [6].

                            The evolution of Windows Security:

                            1. With launch of Windows 10, Microsoft removed the separate settings window from Windows Defender, replacing
                               it with a dedicated page in the main Settings app [6].
                            2. Windows 10 version 1703 introduced **Windows Defender Security Center (WDSC)**, combining Windows Defender's
                               interface with **Windows Security and Maintenance** [7].
                            3. Version 1803 renamed the Windows Defender settings page to **Windows Security** and redesigned it to emphasize
                               various protection areas [3].                               
                            4. In version 1809, **Windows Defender Security Center** was renamed to **Windows Security (WSC)** [1] [2] [4] [8].

                            Windows Security features include:

                            - **Virus & threat protection:** [1] [2]:
                              Manages antivirus scans and updates [1] [2].
                              It includes managing **Defender Antivirus** [1] [2] [8].
                            - **Account protection:** [1] [2]
                              Handles sign-in options and account settings, including **Windows Hello** [1] [2].
                            - **Firewall & network protection:** [1] [2]
                              Controls firewall settings and monitors network connections [1] [2].
                              **Windows Security** brand does not include the firewall component **Windows Firewall** [8].
                              However, it allows viewing and managing it, including turning it on and off [9].
                            - **App & browser control:** [1] [2]
                              Manages Microsoft Defender SmartScreen settings to protect against potentially harmful apps, files, and downloads [1].
                            - **Device security:** [1] [2]
                              Oversees built-in security features to protect against malware attacks [1] [2].
                            - **Device performance & health** [1] [2]:
                              Monitors device health and provides system update information [1].
                            - **Family options:** [1] [2]
                              Allows management of family online activity and connected devices [1] [2].

                            Scripts in this disables or adjust Windows Security components to:

                            - Minimize data collection by limiting interactions with Microsoft's security services
                            - Increase user control over security settings by blocking UI access to Defender

                            This allows users to decide which security features to manage or disable without interference.
                            However, be aware that limiting access to these settings may result in inadequate responses to
                            security threats, potentially making the system more vulnerable.

                            > **Caution:**
                            > Disabling these features may prevent you from configuring and viewing Defender settings, which may reduce your
                            > system's security and convenience.
                            > Consider alternative security measures if you disable Windows Security components.

                                    This category provides scripts to disable background services supporting Defender interface elements.
                                    These services enable real-time updates and interactions with Defender's security features.

                                    Disabling these services may:

                                    - Reduce system resource usage
                                    - Minimize background processes related to the Defender interface
                                    - Limit potential data collection associated with Defender's user interface

                                    However, this action may also:

                                    - Prevent certain security notifications from appearing
                                    - Limit your ability to interact with Defender through its standard interface
                                    - Reduce awareness of important security events

                                    > **Caution:**
                                    > - Disabling these services may reduce visibility into your system's security status while

                                        docs: |-
                                            This script disables the Windows Security APIs, which are used by Windows and third-party security
                                            software to report system security status.

                                            These APIs are known as **Windows Security APIs** [1], or **Windows Security Center APIs** [2].
                                            They allow security software to communicate with the Windows Security app [1].
                                            This app monitors the system's security status and provides alerts about potential vulnerabilities [1].

                                            Disabling these APIs can improve privacy by preventing the collection and reporting of security-related
                                            system information.
                                            It may also enhance system performance by reducing background processes.

                                            However, disabling these APIs has significant trade-offs:

                                            - **Reduced security awareness:**
                                              You won't receive alerts about potential security issues through the Windows Security app.
                                            - **Impaired functionality of security software:**
                                              Third-party security solutions may lose their ability to report status to Windows Security without these APIs.

                                            > **Caution:**
                                            > Disabling these APIs may reduce your system's ability to detect and respond to security threats.

                                        docs: |-
                                            This script disables a system service that operates in the background, monitoring your device and
                                            providing security notifications.

                                            This service is named **Defender Shell Service** [1], also referred to as **Security Health SSO** [2].
                                            It is a component of ***Windows Security** [3] (formerly **Windows Defender Security Center** [4]).
                                            It operates in the background, scanning your device for threats and sending notifications as necessary [3].
                                            The service is associated with the `SecurityHealthSystray.exe` process, which manages system tray
                                            functionality for **Windows Security** [3] [5].
                                            The system tray, or notification area, is part of the Windows taskbar at the bottom-right corner of the screen [6].

                                            Disabling this service may enhance your privacy by reducing background monitoring.
                                            It also improves system performance by stopping a continuously running process.
                                            However, it may decrease your system's security by disabling a key component of Windows Security.
                                            Disabling this component, even while other Windows Security features remain active, may lead to system errors
                                            such as error code `0xc000012f` [3] [5].

                                            > **Caution:** Disabling this service may weaken your computer's security and could result in system errors.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            This script disables the Windows Security Service, a component that manages
                                            various Windows security features.

                                            This service is known as **Windows Security Service** [1], `SecurityHealthService` [2]
                                            or **Windows Security Health Service** [2] [3].
                                            It provides device protection and system health information [1] [3].

                                            This service is part of the **Windows Security** interface [2] [4].
                                            **Windows Security** is a centralized interface managing various Windows security features [5].
                                            In earlier Windows versions, this interface was called **Security Center** [5].

                                            This service is also a component of **Defender for Endpoint** and **Defender Antivirus** [4].
                                            However, disabling this service does not affect the functionality of Defender Antivirus [2].

                                            Disabling this service may enhance privacy by limiting data collection related to system security.
                                            It may also improve system performance by preventing the service from running in the background.
                                            However, it may decrease security by disabling the Windows Security interface and restricting access
                                            to security information.

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > Disabling this service may prevent you from accessing Windows Security features and
                                            > receiving important security notifications.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            The **Windows Security** interface relies on this service [2].

                                            By default, Windows is set to start this service manually [1].
                                            Although tests indicate it runs automatically on Windows 10 and 11.

                                            The service is located at `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\SecurityHealthService.exe` [1] [3] [6]

                                            This script disables the Security Health Service's COM objects, which prevents
                                            the Windows Security Center from running.

                                            Security Health Service is also known as **Windows Security Service** [1] [2]
                                            or **Windows Security Health Service** [1] [2] [3].
                                            It is a fundamental component of Windows security features [3].

                                            The script disables various Component Object Model (COM) objects related to
                                            this service.
                                            **COM (Component Object Model)** is a system enabling interaction between software
                                            components in Windows [4].

                                            Disabling these components may enhance your privacy by limiting the system's ability
                                            to monitor and report on your computer's security status.
                                            It may also improve system performance by preventing these services from running in
                                            the background.

                                            However, disabling these components may lower your system's overall security.
                                            This script does not directly disable Defender Antivirus or Defender Firewall [3].
                                            But it may prevent Windows from alerting you about potential security issues or
                                            threats.

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > Disabling these components may increase your system's vulnerability to security threats
                                            > and prevent you from receiving important security notifications

                                            This script disables the Windows Security Health Agent (WSHA).

                                            WSHA is a component that transmits a client's security health state to a network policy server [1].
                                            It sends a summary of Windows Update-related information [2].
                                            This data transmission may raise privacy concerns for users who wish to limit the information shared 
                                            with Microsoft or network administrators.

                                            By disabling WSHA, this script improves privacy by preventing the automatic sending of system health
                                            and update information.
                                            It may also slightly increase system performance by reducing background processes.

                                            However, disabling WSHA may reduce security by limiting the ability of network administrators to assess and maintain
                                            the security health of connected devices. This could potentially leave systems more vulnerable to threats.

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > Disabling this agent may interfere with your organization's security policies and leave your system more vulnerable to threats.

                                            This script disables the Windows Security Health Core component.

                                            Windows Security Health Core is a system library that manages security settings, monitors
                                            system integrity, and interfaces with various security features [2] [3].
                                            It provides status information to both the system and users, handling security-related
                                            Windows services [3].

                                            Disabling this component may enhance privacy by limiting the system's monitoring and reporting
                                            of security-related activities.
                                            It may slightly improve system performance by removing background processes related to security
                                            monitoring.

                                            However, this action may significantly reduce system security by disabling essential security
                                            features and monitoring.
                                            This can make your system more vulnerable to threats and malware.

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > Disabling this component weakens Windows security monitoring, potentially leaving your system

                                            The **Windows Security Health UDK** is a core library that manages key aspects of **Windows Security** [1] [2].
                                            UDK stands for *Undocked Developer Kit* [3], *Undocked Dev Kit* [4], *Windows UDK* [3] [4].
                                            It's also referred to as *Undocked Shell* [5].
                                            It coordinates shell experiences (user interfaces) [6] and adds new features to the Windows desktop
                                            independently of full system updates [5].

                                            This component's key functions include:

                                            - Providing security-related services [1]
                                            - Managing security policies [1] [2]
                                            - Gathering system information [1] [2]
                                            - Handling event logging [1] [2]
                                            - Performing cryptographic operations [1]
                                            - Managing user accounts and sessions [1] [2]
                                            - Supporting Windows Defender features [1] [2]
                                            - Managing containerization and virtualization [1] [2]
                                            - Configuring firewall settings [2]

                                            This script may enhance privacy by limiting the system's ability to collect and process security-related data.
                                            It may also increase system performance by reducing background processes related to security monitoring.

                                            However, disabling this component may significantly weaken your system's security.
                                            According to community reports, it may disable the Windows Security background service and interface [7].
                                            This may leave your system more vulnerable to threats.

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > This action may expose your system to additional security threats, especially if you're unfamiliar

                                            This script disables the Windows Security Health Host.

                                            The Windows Security Health Host monitors and reports on the Windows operating system's security status [1] [2].
                                            It continuously checks system security aspects like Defender antivirus, firewall status, and the presence of the latest security patches [2].
                                            It automatically starts with Windows and runs in the background [2].

                                            By disabling this process, the script may improve privacy by preventing the constant monitoring and reporting of system security status.
                                            It may also increase system performance by eliminating the background process.

                                            However, this action may reduce system security.
                                            Without the Security Health Host, **Windows Security** can't effectively monitor or report on the system's security health [1].
                                            **Windows Security** is a built-in Windows feature that offers a unified interface for various security products, including Defender antivirus [3].

                                            > **Caution**: Disabling this feature may leave your system vulnerable to security threats without your knowledge.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            This script removes the executable file `SecurityHealthHost.exe` from the `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32` directory [2] [4] [5].
                                            It also prevents any future execution of the `SecurityHealthHost.exe` process.

                                            This script disables the Windows Security service.

                                            Microsoft refers to this service as:

                                            - Security Center Service [1]
                                            - Security Center [1] [2]
                                            - Security Center (wscsvc) Service [2]
                                            - WSCSVC (Windows Security Center) service [1] [2]
                                            - Windows Security Center Service [3]

                                            **Windows Security Center** is renamed to **Windows Security** in newer versions of Windows [4].

                                            This service monitors and reports security health settings on your computer [1] [2].
                                            These settings include the status of protective software, system updates, and critical security configurations [1] [2].

                                            The service allows security software to report their status and enables programs to access this data [1] [2].
                                            It powers the **Security and Maintenance** control panel and system tray alerts [1] [2].
                                            **Network Access Protection (NAP)** uses it for network quarantine decisions [1] [2].
                                            **Windows Security**, which displays protection status, relies on this service [3].

                                            Disabling this service does not disable **Defender Antivirus** or **Defender Firewall** [3].

                                            This script may improve your privacy by reducing the information collected and shared about your system's security status.

                                            Disabling this service may also enhance system performance by eliminating background processes.

                                            However, this action may lower your overall security [3] [5].
                                            This may lead to issues with non-Microsoft antivirus solutions and affect how their information is displayed in the
                                            **Windows Security** app [5].
                                            You will not receive important security alerts or status updates when this service is disabled.

                                            > **Caution:** Disabling this service may make your system more vulnerable to threats and disrupt security software.

                                            ### Technical Details

                                            This script disables:

                                            - The `wscsvc` service [1] [2] [3] [5]
                                            - The service file `wscsvc.dll` [1] [2]

                                            This script disables the Windows Security service (`wscsvc`) communication with other security software.

                                            The Windows Security uses APIs (special programming tools) that allow security programs to
                                            share their status with Windows [1] [2].
                                            In recent Windows versions, this service is part of **Windows Security** (formerly **Windows Security Center**) [3].

                                            Disabling these interfaces may enhance privacy by limiting the information shared about your system's security status.
                                            It may also improve system performance by reducing background processes.

                                            However, disabling this communication has significant drawbacks:

                                            - It may disrupt how security information is displayed in the Windows Security app [4].
                                            - Third-party antivirus solutions may not function properly or report their status correctly [4].
                                            - You may miss important security warnings or updates.
                                            - **Network Access Protection (NAP)**, which helps secure your network, may not work properly [1] [2].

                                            > **Caution:** This script may reduce your system's overall security by disrupting communication between security components.

                                    This script removes the **Scan with Microsoft Defender** option from the right-click context menu.
                                    
                                    This script enhances user privacy by limiting engagement with Defender's data collection processes.
                                    Defender may collect data during scans and at regular intervals, which some users may find
                                    unnecessary or unwanted.

                                    Removing this option only affects the context menu appearance and does not disable Defender
                                    or its other functions.

                                    > **Caution**: This may reduce system security by making it less convenient to perform on-demand
                                    > scans of specific files or folders.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    The script functions by altering specific registry keys that correspond to the Defender context menu option.
                                    It specifically targets the CLSID `{09A47860-11B0-4DA5-AFA5-26D86198A780}`, which is associated with this option [1] [2].
                                    The script alters keys in the `HKLM\Software\Classes` branch, which automatically reflects in the `HKCR`
                                    (`HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT`) view [3].

                                    The deletion of this key effectively removes the **Scan with Microsoft Defender** option from the context menu.
                                    This feature is provided by `shellext.dll` file located in Defender's program files [1].

                                    **Windows Security** is an interface introduced in Windows 10, version 1703 [1].
                                    It was previously named **Windows Defender Security Center** [1].
                                    It offers a unified interface to manage security settings and monitor system status [1] [2].

                                    The icon in the system tray is controlled by the `SecurityHealthSystray.exe` file [3] [4].

                                    > Removing the icon may hide important security alerts and make accessing security settings less convenient.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    The script modifies the registry to stop this file from running on startup, effectively removing the icon.
                                    It specifically removes the `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run!SecurityHealth` registry key.
                                    This key exists in modern Windows versions (tested on Windows 11 22H2 and Windows 10 22H2) with a
                                    default value of `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\SecurityHealthSystray.exe`.

                                docs: |-
                                    This script disables the Defender Antivirus interface.

                                    This script keeps the Antimalware User Interface (AM UI) hidden from users [1].
                                    This prevents user interactions with the Defender Antivirus interface.

                                    Several reasons to hide the antivirus interface:

                                    - **Reduced data sharing**:
                                      Minimizing Defender's visible interactions can potentially limit the extent of user data shared with Microsoft,
                                      whether you're using Defender or disabling it for an alternative solution.
                                    - **Minimized Interruptions**:
                                      Hiding the interface prevents users from starting and pausing scans.
                                      It also eliminates prompts that may lead to unknowing data sharing.
                                      This approach streamlines the user experience and reduces the risk of accidental data sharing.
                                    - **Reduced notifications**:
                                      Enabling headless UI mode in Windows 10 (version 1703 and newer) hides Defender Antivirus notifications [2].
                                      It prevents users from being overwhelmed with security notifications.
                                      This action can contribute to a cleaner, less interrupted user experience.
                                      By reducing these notifications, the system lessens the chances of users inadvertently
                                      triggering options that may share data.
                                    - **Restricting access**:
                                      In earlier versions of Windows 10, activating this mode not only hides the Defender client interface
                                      but also restricts users from accessing it [2].
                                      If a user attempts to open the interface, they are met with a warning, indicating that
                                      access has been restricted by the system administrator [2].

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > This action limits your ability to manage antivirus settings, manually run scans and view security status.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    The script achieves this by making a specific change in the Windows Registry.
                                    Specifically, it adds a value named `UILockdown` in the
                                    `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\UX Configuration` registry path, setting its
                                    data to `1` [1].

                                    This script disables privacy mode for Defender scans, limiting threat history access to administrators.

                                    By default, privacy mode is enabled [1].
                                    When active, it restricts the display of spyware and potentially dangerous programs to administrators only,
                                    instead of all users on the computer [2].
                                    It blocks non-administrators from viewing threat history [1].

                                    This is a legacy setting that only affects older versions of Defender Antivirus [1].
                                    It has no impact on current platforms [1].

                                    Limiting threat history to administrators has both benefits and drawbacks.
                                    It improves security and privacy by limiting access to sensitive threat information.
                                    However, it may reduce transparency and hinder security efforts for users without admin access who
                                    need this data.

                                    > **Caution**: Non-admin users will be unable to view potential security threats on their accounts.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    The script configures:

                                    - `DisablePrivacyMode` Defender preference using Command Line Interface (CLI) [1] [3].
                                      It sets the value to `$True`, effectively disabling privacy mode [1].
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender\UX Configuration!DisablePrivacyMode` registry value [2].
                                      This undocumented registry key has been verified to work on older Windows versions by the community [2].

                                    **Windows Security** provides a centralized location for managing security settings and viewing system status [1] [2].
                                    This interface was introduced in Windows 10, version 1703 [1].
                                    It was previously known as **Windows Defender Security Center** [1].

                                    Windows Security has various sections, and each can be turned off individually [1].
                                    If all sections are disabled, Windows Security will display in a restricted mode [1].

                                    This category contains scripts to disable Windows security notifications.

                                    Windows sends security notifications to inform users of potential threats, vulnerabilities, and important security events.
                                    These notifications are generated by security components like Windows Security and Defender Antivirus.

                                    Disabling these notifications may:

                                    - Enhance privacy by reducing visible security-related information on your screen
                                    - Improve system performance slightly by preventing these alerts from being processed and displayed

                                    However, disabling these notifications comes with significant risks:

                                    - Decreased awareness of critical security issues and threats
                                    - Potential exposure to unnoticed malware or system vulnerabilities
                                    - Missing important system maintenance tasks

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > Disabling security notifications may significantly reduce your awareness of critical system and security issues.
                                    > This may increase your system's vulnerability to threats.
                                    > Consider these options only if you have alternative security measures in place or are an advanced user who

                                            **Security and Maintenance** was previously known as the **Action Center** [1] or
                                            **Security Center** [1] [2].
                                            It serves as a central interface in Windows for managing security and maintenance settings [3].
                                            It alerts users to important system events, security risks, and maintenance issues [3].

                                            Disabling these notifications may enhance privacy by reducing the visibility of system health and
                                            security details.
                                            It may also slightly improve system performance by preventing these alerts from being processed and
                                            displayed.

                                            However, this action may decrease security by:

                                            - Reducing awareness of critical security or health events.
                                            - Potentially leaving the system vulnerable to unnoticed threats or issues.
                                            - Preventing Windows from alerting you about important system maintenance needs.

                                                    These notifications are enabled by default [5].

                                                    Disabling these notifications may enhance privacy by limiting visible security and health

                                                    of these alerts.

                                                    However, this action may reduce security:

                                                name: Disable Security and Maintenance notification integrations
                                                docs: |-
                                                    This script disables Security and Maintenance integrations that use Component Object Model (COM).
                                                    Previously, **Security and Maintenance** was known as **Action Center** [1].

                                                    *Component Object Model (COM)* enables communication between software components, whether within the
                                                    same process, on the same computer, or across different computers [2].
                                                    By removing registry entries for these integrations, the script prevents Windows from creating and using
                                                    COM objects related to Security and Maintenance notifications.

                                                    This script may improve privacy by reducing the system's ability to generate and display certain notifications
                                                    that may contain sensitive information.
                                                    It may slightly improve system performance by stopping some background processes related to security notifications.

                                                    However, this action has significant trade-offs:

                                                    - It disables security and maintenance notifications, which may leave you unaware of important system issues or security threats.
                                                    - It prevents certain system health checks from running or reporting their results.
                                                    - It may disable parts of the Windows Security Center.
                                                    - It may break functionality in third-party security tools that rely on these integrations.

                                                    > **Caution**:
                                                    > Disabling these integrations may reduce your awareness of critical system and security issues, leaving your system
                                                    > more vulnerable to threats.

                                                name: Disable all Security and Maintenance notifications
                                                docs: |-
                                                    This script disables all Security and Maintenance notifications in Windows,
                                                    potentially enhancing privacy but also reducing system security awareness.

                                                    **Security and Maintenance** was formerly called **Action Center** [1].
                                                    This interface manages and centralizes Windows security and maintenance settings [2] [3] [4]
                                                    It notifies users about key system events, security risks, and maintenance issues [2] [3].
                                                    Windows automatically checks for security and maintenance issues and sends notifications by default [2].

                                                    This script disables notifications for:

                                                    - **Security messages:**
                                                      Windows Update, Internet security settings, Network firewall, Microsoft account
                                                      Spyware and unwanted software protection, User Account Control, Virus protection, Windows activation [2]
                                                    - **Maintenance messages:**
                                                      Windows Backup, Automatic Maintenance, Drive status, Device software, Startup apps,
                                                      Windows Troubleshooting, HomeGroup, File History, Storage Spaces, Work Folders [2]

                                                    Disabling these notifications may improve privacy by hiding system health and security details.
                                                    It may slightly improve system performance by stopping these alerts from being processed and shown.

                                                    However, disabling these notifications may reduce security by:

                                                    - Reducing awareness of critical security or health events
                                                    - Potentially leaving the system vulnerable to unnoticed threats or issues
                                                    - Preventing Windows from alerting you about important system maintenance needs

                                                    > **Caution:**
                                                    > Disabling these notifications may significantly reduce your awareness of critical system and security issues,
                                                    > potentially increasing your system's vulnerability to threats.

                                                    ### Technical Details

                                                    This script removes or modifies the following registry keys:

                                                    - `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Security and Maintenance\Providers` [5] [6]
                                                    - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Security and Maintenance\Checks` [5] [6]
                                                    - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Security and Maintenance\Providers` [6] [7]
                                                    - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Action Center\Checks` (outdated) [8] [9] [10]
                                                    - `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Action Center\Providers` (outdated) [11]

                                                    These registry keys are linked to `ActionCenter.dll` [6] [12],
                                                    which is part of the **Security and Maintenance** component [12].

                                            This category provides options to disable various notifications from **Windows Security**.

                                            Windows Security, built into Windows, provides a centralized interface for managing security settings and viewing
                                            system status [1] [2].
                                            It was first introduced in Windows 10, version 1703 [1].
                                            Initially, it was called **Windows Defender Security Center** [1].
                                            It displays notifications via the **Notification Center** [1] (formerly **Action Center** [3] [4]).

                                            Windows Security notifications inform users about device health and security, including firewall updates,
                                            antivirus status, and **Defender SmartScreen** [2].
                                            These notifications are meant to inform users of potential security risks, but some may find them intrusive or unnecessary.

                                            Disabling these notifications may:

                                            - Improve privacy by reducing visible security information that may be sensitive.
                                            - Slightly boost system performance by reducing background processes.

                                            However, disabling these notifications has significant trade-offs:

                                            - You may miss critical security alerts, leaving your system vulnerable.
                                            - You may be unaware of important updates or actions needed to maintain security.

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > Disabling Windows Security notifications may reduce your awareness of critical security events and vulnerabilities.
                                            > Only consider this action if you have alternative security measures in place, such as other monitoring tools or
                                            > strong security practices.

                                                    This script disables all notifications generated by Windows Security.

                                                    **Windows Security** is a built-in Windows feature that offers a unified interface for various
                                                    security products, including **Defender Antivirus** [1].
                                                    This interface was previously called **Security Center** [1].

                                                    By default, local users are notified by Windows Security [2] [3].
                                                    This script blocks these notifications [2] [3].

                                                    This script may enhance your privacy by reducing visible security-related information on your screen.
                                                    It may also slightly improve system performance by reducing the processing and display of these notifications.
                                                    However, disabling these notifications will decrease your awareness of critical security events.

                                                    > **Caution**: Disabling security notifications will leave you unaware of critical security issues on your system.

                                                    ### Technical Details

                                                    The script performs the following actions:

                                                    - Disables push notifications from the Windows Security Center package

                                                    - Configures Group Policy to disable notifications
                                                      `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender Security Center\Notifications!DisableNotifications` [2] [3].
                                                    - Modifies user interface settings to prevent the display of notifications via
                                                      `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender Security Center\Notifications` [5].

                                                    This script disables Windows Security-related notifications on the Windows taskbar.

                                                    It removes taskbar integrations (AppUserModelId) for Windows Security components [1] [2].
                                                    Windows Security is also called **Security Center** in older versions of Windows [3].
                                                    *AppUserModelIds* link processes, files, and windows to specific applications, organizing them
                                                    on the Windows taskbar, managing Jump Lists, and controlling pinning [4].

                                                    This script may enhance privacy by reducing the visibility of security-related information on your desktop.
                                                    It may also slightly improve system performance by disabling these notification processes.

                                                    However, disabling these notifications may reduce your awareness of important security issues.

                                                    > **Caution**:
                                                    > Disabling taskbar integrations may leave you unaware of critical security issues on your system.

                                            This category contains scripts to disable various notifications from Defender Antivirus.

                                            **Defender Antivirus**, built into Windows, protects your device from malware and
                                            other threats [1].
                                            It analyzes your data using machine learning and cloud-based protection technologies [1].
                                            This data analysis raises privacy concerns.

                                            Key features of Defender Antivirus include:

                                            - Real-time protection against known and new threats [1]
                                            - Behavior-based detection to identify suspicious activities [1]

                                            Defender Antivirus typically sends notifications when:

                                            - Scans are completed (both scheduled and manual) [2]
                                            - Threats are detected [2]
                                            - System status changes occur [2]

                                            These notifications appear on your device and in the **Notification Center** [2]
                                            (previously known as the **Action Center** [3]).

                                            Disabling these notifications may:

                                            - Enhance privacy by reducing visible information about your system's security status
                                            - Improve system performance by reducing background processes

                                            However, disabling notifications may:

                                            - Lower your awareness of security threats
                                            - Increase the risk of unnoticed malware or system issues

                                            The scripts in this category apply to both the standard **Defender Antivirus** and
                                            the **Defender for Endpoint** suite [1] [2].

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > Disabling security notifications may prevent you from noticing critical system threats.
                                            > This may reduce your security if you do not have alternative measures in place.

                                                    By default, Defender Antivirus notifies you of potential threats and system status [1] [2].
                                                    This script disables these notifications [1] [2].

                                                    Disabling these notifications may enhance privacy by limiting visible information on your
                                                    system's security status.
                                                    It may also slightly improve system performance by reducing background processes related to
                                                    notification display.
                                                    However, this action may reduce your security awareness, potentially leaving your system vulnerable to
                                                    unnoticed threats such as malware.

                                                    > **Caution**:
                                                    > Disabling notifications reduces your awareness of security alerts, which may compromise system security.

                                    This category includes scripts that disable various components of the
                                    **Security and Maintenance** feature.

                                    **Security and Maintenance** was previously known as **Action Center** [1] [2].
                                    This feature provides a central interface for managing Windows security and maintenance settings [1] [2].
                                    It monitors and reports on system health, including security threats, software updates, and hardware issues [3].

                                    Disabling these components enhances privacy by reducing system monitoring and data collection associated with
                                    security and maintenance.
                                    This may also improve system performance by stopping background processes associated with these functions.

                                    However, disabling these components can significantly impact system security.
                                    It limits the system's ability to alert users to potential threats, vulnerabilities, and critical
                                    maintenance issues.
                                    This may make the system more vulnerable to security risks if not properly managed.

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > Disabling Security and Maintenance features may leave your system more vulnerable to security threats

                                            This script disables the Security and Maintenance library, a core component of
                                            Windows security monitoring.

                                            **Security and Maintenance** was formerly known as **Action Center** [1].
                                            It is a central interface for managing Windows security and maintenance settings [2] [3].
                                            By default, Windows automatically checks for security and maintenance issues and sends notifications
                                            via this interface [2].

                                            This script disables the `ActionCenter.dll` library, which is responsible for:

                                            - Managing security and maintenance notifications [4]
                                            - Processing and caching system health notifications [4]
                                            - Handling the icon and its tooltips in the system tray [4]
                                            - Interacting with various Windows components to check system health status [4]
                                            - Launching the Control Panel applet for Security and Maintenance [4]
                                            - Creating and managing toast notifications for security and maintenance issues [4]
                                            - Interfacing with Windows event logs to gather system health information [4]
                                            - Handling user interactions with notifications and the interface [4]
                                            - Managing settings related to security and maintenance checks [4]

                                            Disabling this library may enhance privacy by reducing system monitoring and data collection
                                            related to security and maintenance activities.
                                            It may also improve system performance by stopping background processes related to these functions.

                                            However, disabling this library will impair the functionality of Security and Maintenance [5].
                                            It reduces system security by disabling important notifications about potential
                                            threats and system vulnerabilities.
                                            This change also complicates the management of security settings, potentially making it harder
                                            for users to maintain a secure system.

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > This action may leave your system more vulnerable to security threats and maintenance issues if not carefully managed.

                                            This script removes the `ActionCenter.dll` file  [4] [5] [6].
                                            This file belongs to **Security and Maintenance** [6].
                                            The name of the files comes from *Action Center* which was the previous name
                                            of *Security and Maintenance* [1].

                                            Security and Maintenance (previously **Action Center** [1] [2]) is a central interface
                                            for managing Windows security and maintenance settings [2] [3].

                                            It controls:

                                            - Security components such as *firewall*, *Internet security settings*, and *User Account Control (UAC)* [3]
                                            - Maintenance features as *automatic Maintenance*, *drive status*, and *file history* [3]

                                            This interface also displays relevant notifications [3].

                                            After running this script, **Security and Maintenance** will be disabled and inaccessible.
                                            This enhances privacy by limiting the system's ability to monitor and report on security and maintenance issues.
                                            It may slightly improve system performance by disabling related background processes.

                                            However, this change may reduce overall system security and make managing important security settings more difficult.
                                            You will need to monitor and adjust these settings manually.

                                            > **Caution**: Disabling this feature may increase vulnerability to security threats and maintenance
                                            > issues unless carefully managed.

                                        docs: |-
                                            This script disables the Security and Maintenance desktop integration in Windows.

                                            Windows automatically loads certain applications at startup using **Shell Service Objects** [1].
                                            These objects are loaded early during startup by `explorer.exe`, the core shell for Windows [1].
                                            Shell Service Objects handle tasks like file management, system operations, and user interface interactions [2].

                                            The script removes the **Security and Maintenance Shell Service Object** [3] [4].
                                            This object shows security and health notifications on your desktop.
                                            Disabling this may reduce certain Security and Maintenance capabilities, such as specific file operations,
                                            window management, system tasks, service control, help functions, security dialogs, shell integration,
                                            and application search [2].

                                            Disabling this integration may:

                                            - Enhance privacy by reducing the visibility of security and health-related information on your desktop.
                                            - Improve system performance by reducing system resource usage associated with these notifications.

                                            However, disabling notifications may reduce your awareness of important security and health issues.

                                            > **Caution:**
                                            > This script may result in losing access to certain **Security and Maintenance** features
                                            > and missing important security alerts.

                                    This script disables the Windows Defender Firewall Control Panel applet, restricting access
                                    to firewall settings through this specific interface.

                                    The Windows Defender Firewall Control Panel applet is a tool for configuring the Defender Firewall [1].
                                    It can be accessed by typing `firewall.cpl` in the **Start** menu and pressing **Enter** [1].

                                    Disabling this applet enhances security by reducing the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities in the
                                    firewall's configuration interface.
                                    This action preserves your firewall settings by blocking modifications through the Control Panel applet.
                                    It may also slightly boost system performance by eliminating unnecessary components.

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > Disabling this applet removes a user-friendly interface for configuring the firewall.
                                    > Users can still manage firewall settings through other means, such as PowerShell or
                                    > the **Windows Security** app.

                                    The Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security (WFAS) is a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in
                                    offering advanced configuration options for your firewall [1].
                                    It can be accessed locally or through group policies by typing `wf.msc` in the Start menu [1].

                                    The **Microsoft Management Console (MMC)** acts as a toolbox for managing various Windows components,
                                    including hardware, software, and network settings [2].
                                    A **snap-in** is a specific type of tool within this MMC toolbox [2].

                                    Disabling WFAS may enhance privacy by removing an interface that could be used for network monitoring.
                                    It may also slightly boost system performance by reducing background processes.

                                    However, this action removes a user-friendly interface for configuring the firewall.
                                    It may reduce your security by making firewall management more difficult to access.

                                    This script disables only the WFAS interface, not the firewall itself.
                                    Firewall settings can still be managed through other methods, such as PowerShell or Windows Security.

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > This script removes a user-friendly tool for managing the firewall, potentially making it harder to
                                    > control computer security settings.

                                name: Remove "Windows Security" app (`SecHealthUI`) (breaks Windows Security user interface)
                                docs: |-
                                    This script removes the "Windows Security" app [1], known as `SecHealthUI` [2] [3].
                                    This app serves as the interface for Windows Security [2], helping users monitor and manage their computer's security [4].
                                    It provides alerts and guidance on vulnerabilities through the Action Center [4].

                                    However, uninstalling the "Windows Security" app has significant implications:

                                    - It may increase vulnerability to threats by no longer alerting users about security issues or communicating updates through the Action Center [4].
                                    - Disabling its interface can hinder the effective management of security settings, including tamper protection [5].

                                    Despite these risks, removing the app can enhance privacy in several ways:

                                    - **Less personal data collection**: Reduces the collection and display of personal and system data such as threats [6], limiting information used to analyze user behavior.
                                    - **More control over security settings**: Encourages managing security settings programmatically, reducing accidental misconfigurations and unauthorized access.
                                    - **Decreased notifications and alerts**: Reduces the number of notifications that may expose sensitive information.
                                    - **User choice in security tools**: Offers freedom to choose alternative privacy-focused security measures.
                                    - **Increased anonymity**: By uninstalling the app, users reduce the amount of data shared under the terms of
                                    [Microsoft's privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20231006103250/https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/privacystatement),
                                    which allows Microsoft to collect and share data with external entities when the app is in use.

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [7] [8].
                                    The package is named `Microsoft.Windows.SecHealthUI` on Windows 10 and `Microsoft.SecHealthUI` on Windows 11 [1] [2].

                                    It operates independently from individual Defender features [9] and is updated separately from the operating system [10].
                                    Uninstalling it does not disable Microsoft Defender Antivirus or Firewall [11],
                                    and Windows will continue sending security notifications unless disabled separately [12].

                                    > **Caution**: Uninstalling "Windows Security" app can expose your system to threats and limit your ability to configure
                                    > security settings. It should only be done with a full understanding of the consequences.

                                docs: |-
                                    This script disables outdated Defender Antivirus user interface components.

                                    The **Windows Defender User Experience Host** managed communication between Windows components and apps,
                                    including the discontinued Windows Defender Security Center [1].
                                    This interface is not present in modern Windows versions, so this script will not affect recent Windows systems.

                                    Disabling this component may enhance privacy on older systems by reducing monitoring and data
                                    collection from the Defender components.
                                    It helps maintain control over privacy preferences and reduces the risk of unintended changes.
                                    This action may also improve system performance by stopping processes that use system resources.
                                    Removing obsolete software reduces the potential attack surface, aligning with security best practices.

                                    However, this action may reduce system security if you are using older versions of Windows.
                                    Carefully weigh the privacy benefits against potential security risks before applying this script.

                                    > **Caution**: This script limits the Defender user interface on older Windows versions.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    This script removes several components related to the Windows Defender User Experience (`MpUx`), including:

                                    - MP UX Host (AppID: `FDA74D11-C4A6-4577-9F73-D7CA8586E10D`) [2]
                                    - MP UX Host [3] [4] (CLSID: `FDA74D11-C4A6-4577-9F73-D7CA8586E10D`) [2] [3] [4] [5]
                                    - WD modern host server [1] [4] (File: `%PROGRAMFILES%\Windows Defender\MpUXSrv.exe` [4])
                                    - Defender MpUxAgent [6] (File: `%PROGRAMDATA%\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\*\MPUXAGENT.DLL` [5] [7])
                                    - Defender MpUxAgent (CLSID: `4DB116D1-9B24-4DFC-946B-BFE03E852002` [5] [7])
                                    - Defender MpUxAgent (CLSID: `2DCD7FDB-8809-48E4-8E4F-3157C57CF987}` [5] [7])
                                    - Defender Data Loss Prevention UI (Application User Model ID: `Windows.Defender.MpUxDlp` [5])
                                    - MpUx Agent Host [5] [8] (AppID: `1111a26d-ef95-4a45-9f55-21e52adf9887` [5] [8])
                                    - COM Proxy for mpuxhost (MP Modern shell host) [9] (file: `%PROGRAMFILES%\Windows Defender\mpuxhostproxy.dll` [3] [7])
                                    - PSFactoryBuffer [3] (CLSID: `13F6A0B6-57AF-4BA7-ACAA-614BC89CA9D8` [2] [3] [7])
                                    - PSFactoryBuffer [3] (CLSID: `94F35585-C5D7-4D95-BA71-A745AE76E2E2` [2] [3])

                                    Tests confirm that these components are not present in Windows versions from Windows 10 19H1 and Windows 11 21H2 onwards.

                        docs: |-
                            This category disables Defender Exploit Guard, potentially enhancing privacy and
                            system performance.

                            Exploit Guard is also called **Windows Defender Exploit Guard** [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]
                            or **Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard** [6].
                            This component has been a built-in feature of Windows 10 since version 1709 [1] [5].
                            It's the successor to the **Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET)** [1] [5].

                            Exploit Guard uses Microsoft Cloud for machine learning and to check websites and IP addresses [1].
                            Disabling it may enhance privacy by preventing these connections.
                            It may improve system performance by reducing background processes.
                            It also increases user autonomy by enabling choices about which programs, scripts, and websites can connect
                            without automatic intervention.

                            However, disabling Exploit Guard may reduce protection against certain types of attacks.
                            Users should carefully weigh the trade-offs between enhanced privacy/performance and potential security
                            risks when disabling this feature.

                            Exploit Guard consists of four main components:

                            1. **Attack Surface Reduction (ASR):**
                              Blocks Office-, script-, and email-based threats [1] [2] [7].
                            2. **Network protection:**
                              Blocks outbound connections to untrusted hosts/IP addresses using Defender SmartScreen [1] [2] [4].
                              It extends SmartScreen to the operating system level [4].
                            3. **Controlled folder access:**
                              Protects sensitive data from ransomware by blocking untrusted processes from accessing protected folders [1] [2] [3].
                            4. **Exploit protection:**
                              Applies exploit mitigation techniques to operating system processes and applications [1] [2] [3].

                            These components are enabled and configured by default on Windows 10 and 11 [1] [3] [8].
                            They can also be remotely configured and set up in managed environments, such as enterprise organizations [2].
                            Disabling Exploit Guard can affect local or organizational configurations, such as those set by schools or employers.

                            **Defender Antivirus** is the built-in antimalware component in Windows [5].
                            Exploit Guard operates independently from Defender Antivirus [5].
                            However, some features, like Attack Surface Reduction, depend on Defender Antivirus to function [1].
                            Exploit Guard may also require Defender Antivirus for some of its configurations [6].

                            Exploit Guard is included in **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint** suite [9] [10].
                            Defender for Endpoint enhances its functionality by providing additional detailed reporting into
                            exploit protection events and blocks as part of the usual alert investigation scenarios [10].
                            Disabling Exploit Guard may impair the functionality of Defender for Endpoint.

                            > **Caution:**
                            > Disabling Exploit Guard may lower your security if you do not have proper security practices
                            > or alternative protections in place.

                                    The task is originally described in the Task Scheduler as: "Task for applying changes to the machine's Exploit Protection settings".

                                    Windows Defender Exploit Guard is a security feature in Windows, designed to prevent potential intrusions [1].
                                    It encompasses various components such as "Attack Surface Reduction (ASR)", "Network protection", "Controlled folder access", and "Exploit protection" [1].

                                    Specifically, the "ExploitGuard MDM policy Refresh" task is in charge of refreshing the Exploit Guard policy settings through Mobile Device Management (MDM) policies [2].
                                    MDM offers a method to remotely adjust the ExploitGuard settings on a device [2].

                                    Microsoft rolled out the Exploit Guard feature starting from Windows 10 version 1709 [3] [4].
                                    
                                    Notably, the National Security Agency (NSA) in the USA has recommended the use of this feature for enhanced security [3].

                            This category provides scripts to disable the deprecated Defender Application Guard, a feature
                            originally designed to protect business environments.

                            Defender Application Guard is also referred to as **Microsoft Defender Application Guard (MDAG)** [1].
                            It was formerly known as Windows Defender Application Guard [2].
                            It uses hardware isolation to protect against internet-based attacks [1].
                            It creates Hyper-V-enabled containers to isolate potentially harmful content [1].

                            MDAG consists of two main components:

                            | Component | Description |
                            | --------- | ----------- |
                            | **Application Guard for Edge** [3] | Isolates untrusted websites in a separate container [1] |
                            | **Application Guard for Office** [3] | Opens untrusted Word, PowerPoint, and Excel files in an isolated environment [1] |

                            Microsoft deprecated MDAG in 2023 and no longer provides updates [1] [3].
                            Despite this, its components remain present in modern Windows computers [4].

                            Disabling MDAG can enhance privacy by reducing data collection associated with this feature.
                            It can also improve system performance by eliminating the overhead of running isolated containers.
                            Furthermore, it can increase security by removing outdated software and reducing your attack surface.

                            However, disabling MDAG may reduce some security protections, particularly for enterprise users.
                            It may also affect functionality on work or school computers that rely on this feature.

                            > **Caution**:
                            > Disabling this feature may decrease security in Edge and Office, and interfere with enterprise settings.

                                    This script disables the deprecated Defender Application Guard feature, which
                                    isolates applications to enhance security.

                                    Application Guard uses **Windows Hypervisor** to create a secure virtual environment for certain apps [1].
                                    This isolation protects the system kernel and other applications from threats due to improper user
                                    interactions or vulnerabilities in isolated apps [1].
                                    Microsoft deprecated the Application Guard feature in 2023 and no longer provides updates [2].

                                    Disabling this feature may improve privacy by reducing system monitoring of application behavior in isolated
                                    environments.
                                    It can also boost system performance by freeing resources allocated to virtualization.
                                    Additionally, it may increase security by removing deprecated software and reducing your attack surface.
                                    However, it may also reduce security by removing a protective layer against threats from untrusted sources.

                                    This script disables Defender Application Guard's remote configuration capability.

                                    Defender Application Guard uses virtualization to isolate untrusted websites and files [1].
                                    As of 2023, Microsoft has discontinued support and updates for the Application Guard feature [2].

                                    This feature can be configured remotely using tools like Microsoft Intune [3].
                                    Remote management of this feature is done through Configuration Service Providers (CSPs) [3] [4].

                                    Disabling this feature enhances privacy by preventing remote modifications to your Application Guard settings.
                                    It can potentially improve system performance by freeing up resources previously used for virtualization.
                                    It can also enhance security by removing outdated software and reducing your attack surface.
                                    However, disabling this feature may reduce security by blocking automatic security updates from your organization.

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > Disabling this feature may limit management systems' ability to adjust security settings automatically.

                category: Disable automatic updates
                docs: |-
                    Disabling automatic updates is often considered counterintuitive when it comes to securing your system. However, there are substantial arguments
                    to consider this option if you're privacy-centric:

                    1. **Patching and Pre-Approval**: Manual control over update deployment allows for pre-emptive approval of patches. This strategy is useful
                    in environments requiring the highest level of security. For instance, military agencies frequently employ air-gapped systems that mandate
                    careful review of each update to mitigate risks such as potential backdoors or data leaks. Similarly, financial institutions often
                    resort to staged rollouts of updates, subjecting them to an in-depth analysis of their implications on security and privacy before broad
                    implementation.

                    2. **Telemetry and Data Transmission**: Automatic updates often come embedded with telemetry data collection mechanisms. Disabling these
                    updates facilitates granular control over the data transmitted back to Microsoft servers. Thus, the decision to disable automatic updates
                    allows you to control the timing and nature of information relayed to these servers.

                    3. **Peer-to-Peer Data Exposure**: Windows employs a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) approach to facilitate update distribution, which can
                    reveal your IP address and some system details to peer systems [1].

                    4. **Configurational integrity**: Updates have the capacity to change pre-configured settings without explicit user consent. This could
                    result in unintended alteration of your privacy settings, leaving you exposed until you realize the change.

                    > **Caution**: While controlling updates enhances your privacy, it can leave your system vulnerable to unpatched exploits.
                    Ensure that you manually review and apply updates on a regular basis. You're essentially trading off some security for a heightened level of
                    privacy.

                        category: Disable Windows Update automatic driver updates
                        docs: |-
                            This category prevents Windows Update from automatically downloading and installing device drivers.

                            A device driver is essential software that enables Windows to communicate with your computer's hardware components [1].
                            For example:

                            - Graphics cards need drivers to display images properly
                            - Printers need drivers to print documents
                            - Mice and keyboards need drivers to function correctly

                            By default, Windows downloads two types of updates for your devices automatically [1]:

                            - **Device drivers:** Software that enables communication between Windows and hardware [1]
                            - **Device information:** High-resolution icons, product details, and manufacturer information [1]

                            This category enhances your privacy by:

                            - Blocking Windows from automatically sending your hardware information to Microsoft [3] [4]
                            - Stopping automatic connections to third-party driver servers [3] [5]
                            - Giving you control over which drivers are installed and when
                            - Reducing data collection during driver installations

                            These settings are officially recommended for:

                            - Privacy protection by Microsoft [4]
                            - Security compliance by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) [3] [5]

                            It may enhance system stability by:

                            - Preventing installation of outdated drivers from Windows database [2]
                            - Avoiding conflicts between manual drivers and Windows Update [2]
                            - Maintaining consistent hardware performance for testing and benchmarks [6]
                            - Reducing unexpected system changes

                            Additionally, this category may improve performance by:

                            - Reducing resource usage by eliminating hardware and network activity from automatic driver downloads.
                            - Maintaining optimized drivers from your device manufacturer for the best performance.

                            > **Caution**:
                            > After using scripts from this category, you may need to manually install and update device drivers.

                                    By default, Windows automatically searches and downloads this information [1] to help you:

                                    - Identify and distinguish between connected devices [2]
                                    - Keep device drivers up-to-date [2]
                                    - View detailed device information like product names and model numbers [2]

                                    This feature sends your system information to Microsoft and downloads data from device manufacturers [5]. [5].
                                    Disabling this feature prevents sensitive information from being sent and stops uncontrolled system updates [5].

                                    After disabling this feature:

                                    - Windows stops retrieving device metadata from the internet  [3] [4] [5]
                                    - Windows no longer downloads custom apps, device drivers, or icons from device manufacturers automatically [2]

                                    This script improves your privacy by:

                                    - Preventing Windows from sending your system information to Microsoft
                                    - Stopping automatic downloads of device metadata and drivers
                                    - Reducing network communication with Microsoft services

                                    This script is recommended for your privacy by Microsoft [3] and Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) [5] to improve your privacy.

                                    This script may also improve system performance by:

                                    - Reducing background network activity
                                    - Preventing automatic downloads
                                    - Stopping unnecessary system processes

                                    > **Caution**: After running this script, you may need to manually download and install device drivers when connecting new hardware.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    This script configures following registry keys:

                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Device Metadata!PreventDeviceMetadataFromNetwork` to configure GPO [3] [4] [5] [6] [9]
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Device Metadata!PreventDeviceMetadataFromNetwork` to configure local setting [1] [6] [7]
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Device Metadata!DeviceMetadataServiceURL` to remove metadata remote URL [6] [7]
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WINEVT\Channels\Microsoft-Windows-DeviceSetupManager/Admin!Enabled` to disable related failure logs [6]

                                    It also removes Windows component related to it called `DeviceMetadataRetrievalClient.dll` [7] [8].
                                    The functionality is managed by `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\DeviceMetadataRetrievalClient.dll` [7] [8].

                                    The following registry keys are sometimes suggested online but do not affect device metadata downloads:

                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceInstall\Settings!PreventDeviceMetadataFromNetwork`
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DeviceInstall\Settings!PreventDeviceMetadataAndThirdPartyDriverDownload`

                                    This script prevents Windows Update from automatically downloading and installing device driver updates.

                                    By default, Windows Update includes driver updates alongside regular system updates [1] [2] [3].
                                    With this script, driver updates will no longer be included in Windows updates [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].

                                    This script improves your privacy by:

                                    - Blocking automatic connections to third-party driver servers
                                    - Reducing data collection during driver installations
                                    - Allowing you to control which drivers are updated and when

                                    Windows Update may replace your manually installed drivers with older versions from its database [6].
                                    This script prevents this problem [6].

                                    This script blocks driver updates specifically during **quality updates** [1] [2] [3].
                                    Quality updates are monthly operating system updates that include security, critical, and driver updates [7].

                                    This script does not block [1]:

                                    - Drivers included within security updates
                                    - Drivers installed/updated manually [5]
                                    - Drivers needed for feature updates [1]
                                    - Drivers that come with Windows [1]

                                    The following updates will still work normally:

                                    - Windows Update when needed
                                    - Device manufacturer websites
                                    - Device Manager

                                    > **Caution**: Consider regularly checking for and install driver updates to maintain device security and performance.

                                    This script prevents Windows Update from automatically finding and installing device drivers.

                                    By default, Windows Update searches for device drivers when new hardware is connected [1].
                                    This search aims to find the best drivers, even with limited network access [1].

                                    While automatic driver installation is convenient, it can cause system  stability issues:

                                    - Windows may install drivers incompatible with your hardware [2]
                                    - You lose control over the driver versions you prefer to use [2]

                                    This script blocks Windows Update from searching for drivers [1] [2] [3].
                                    This gives you more control over driver installations [1] [2].

                                    This script enhances privacy by blocking automatic sharing of hardware information with Microsoft.
                                    Without this script, Windows may send system information to Microsoft and other vendors, and download unplanned updates [3].
                                    This script stops your system information from being shared and blocks unwanted updates [3].
                                    The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) recommends this script for security [3].

                                    This script may also improve system performance by stopping background driver searches.

                                    > **Caution**: After using this script, manual driver download and installation will be required for new hardware.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    The script modifies these registry settings:

                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\DriverSearching!SearchOrderConfig` [2] [4]
                                      - Sets the value to `0` to block driver updates [2] [4]
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DriverSearching!SearchOrderConfig` [1] [3]
                                      - Sets the value to `2` to stop Windows Update driver searches [1]

                                    While automatic updates are convenient, they may install unwanted or outdated drivers, impacting system stability and privacy.

                                    By disabling this feature, you gain more control over driver installations [3].
                                    This is especially important for graphics drivers (e.g., AMD, NVIDIA), input device drivers (e.g., mouse, keyboard),

                                    This script prevents Windows from searching Windows Update for device drivers when local drivers are not found.

                                    By default, Windows automatically searches Windows Update for device drivers [1] [2] [3].
                                    Windows searches for drivers in the following order:

                                    - Local installation [1]
                                    - Removable media (USB drives, CD-ROMs) [1]
                                    - Windows Update [1]

                                    Running this script removes Windows Update from the driver search locations [1] [2].
                                    It also removes the Windows Update option from the driver installation wizard dialog [4].
                                    After running this script, Windows Update will not be searched for drivers when a new device is installed [2] [3].

                                    This script enhances your privacy by:
                                        
                                    - Preventing automatic connections to Microsoft servers for driver updates
                                    - Stopping the transmission of system information to hardware vendors [5]
                                    - Lowering the risk of sensitive data leaving your device

                                    This script configuration is recommended by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), 
                                    a U.S. Department of Defense agency that provides IT security guidelines [5].

                                    - Eliminating network requests during device installation
                                    - Reducing background processes related to driver updates
                                    - Speeding up the driver installation process

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > You may need to download drivers manually from manufacturer websites since Windows Update will no longer provide them automatically.

                                    This script enhances privacy by:

                                    - Preventing automatic driver data collection by Microsoft
                                    - Keeping your system's hardware information within your organization [3]
                                    - Reducing unexpected system changes from automatic driver installations [3]

                                    The script is recommended by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) as a security measure [3].

                                    Other benefits include:

                                    - Improves system stability by blocking unexpected driver updates [3]
                                    - Reduces system slowdown from background update checks
                                    - Gives you more control over which drivers are installed

                                    Some devices may not work at their best until you install the appropriate drivers.
                                    After enabling this script, you will need to either:

                                    - Set up an internal update server
                                    - Manually download and install drivers for your hardware

                                    > **Caution**: You may need to manually download and install device drivers when necessary.

                            This script disables the Automatic Updates feature on Windows.

                            Automatic Updates downloads and installs updates without requiring explicit user permission [1] [2].
                            When enabled, it automatically checks for updates from the Windows Update website whenever you are online [2].
                            By default, Automatic Updates is enabled [1] [3].

                            Disabling Automatic Updates provides users control over when and how updates are installed.
                            This enhances privacy by minimizing automatic data transfers to Microsoft servers.

                            However, disabling Automatic Updates prevents the system from automatically receiving important security patches or feature updates.
                            This may increase your system's vulnerability to security threats if updates are not installed manually.
                            It is recommended to regularly check for and install updates manually to maintain system security.

                            > **Caution:**
                            > Disabling Automatic Updates may leave the system unprotected against known vulnerabilities.
                            > Consider manually checking and installing updates to ensure security.

                            ### Technical Details

                            This script modifies the `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU!NoAutoUpdate` registry value [3] [4].

                            The `NoAutoUpdate` setting accepts these values [4] [5]:

                            - `0`: Automatic Updates are enabled.
                            - `1`: Automatic Updates are disabled.
                            
                            By default, Windows enables Automatic Updates by setting `NoAutoUpdate` to `0` [3].
                            This script disables Automatic Updates by setting `NoAutoUpdate` to `1` [3] [4] [5].

                            This script changes how your Windows computer handles automatic updates by modifying the `AUOptions` registry key.
                            After running this script, your computer will notify you before downloading any updates [1] [2] [3].

                            In the default setup, your Windows system is configured to download and install updates automatically without notifying you [4].
                            This means that new updates could be installed on your system without your explicit approval.

                            By forcing Windows to notify you before downloading updates, this script hands back control over your system to you.
                            This feature enhances your privacy and minimizes risks because you get to manually review and approve each update before it's installed.

                            To explain the technical aspect, the `AUOptions` registry key is a setting stored under
                            `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU` in your computer's registry [1] [3].
                            A value of `2` for `AUOptions` means that you will be notified before any updates are downloaded and installed [1] [2].
                            On older versions of Windows, setting this key to `1` would prevent the system from even checking for updates [5].
                            However, starting from Windows 10, the key `1` has a different meaning [2][3].

                            Running this script doesn't disable updates; it just ensures that you are informed and have the final say on
                            whether to download them or not.

                            This script stops Windows from automatically installing updates every day. By doing so, you gain control over when update
                            happen on your computer [1] [2].

                            By default, Windows is set to automatically update every day [2]. Having control over the update timing allows you to review

                            Technically, what the script does is remove a specific setting in the computer's system registry, the `ScheduledInstallDay` key
                            from `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU` [1] [2].

                            Disabling the scheduled install day ensures that updates won't be forcibly applied on a specific day of the week.

                            This script turns off the automatic installation of Windows updates that are set to occur at a specific time.
                            By doing this, you take back control over when your computer updates itself [1] [2] [3].
                            The default behavior is to install updates at 3 AM [3].

                            Windows updates can be important for system security, but automatic installation could occur at inconvenient times and may even
                            restart your computer without prior warning. This could interrupt your tasks and may send data about your system to external servers.
                            By disabling the automatic scheduled installation time, you can manually control when updates are installed [3], ensuring that you're
                            aware of any changes to your system.

                            The script works by removing a specific registry key called `ScheduledInstallTime` under
                            `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU` [2] [3]. This is the system setting that controls the scheduled update time.

                            Disabling these update services is also a privacy measure. Some updates can change privacy settings or add features that
                            collect user data. By controlling update services, users can review and approve any changes before they take effect.

                            > **Caution**: Disabling Windows update services may lead to missed critical security patches and feature updates.
                            > Consider the balance between maintaining privacy and ensuring system security and stability.

                                    This script turns off the Windows Update service, which is technically known as Windows Update Agent [1] [2].
                                    By disabling this service, the automatic detection, download, and installation of updates for both Windows and other
                                    installed programs are halted [3] [4].

                                    Update can often come bundled with changes that could affect your privacy settings or introduce features that collect
                                    more of your data. Taking control of when and how updates are applied provides you with the opportunity to review any changes
                                    before they take effect.

                                    By default, the service is enabled and set to start up manually [5].

                                    If you disable this service, you won't be able to use the Windows Update feature for automatic updates [5]. Additionally,
                                    other software on your computer won't be able to access the functionalities provided by the Windows Update Agent,
                                    commonly known as WUA API [5].

                                    > **Caution:** This script stops Windows Update Agent's ability to check for and manage system updates. This means your system
                                    > won't automatically receive important updates, which could leave it vulnerable to specific security risks and performance issues

                                    This service is in charge of managing the download and installation of Windows updates [1] [2].

                                    By default, the service is enabled and set to start up manually [1].

                                    While updates can be crucial for the security of your system, this service can sometimes install them without your approval.
                                    This lack of control can pose risks to your privacy, as data might be sent from your system without your knowledge.

                                    Windows updates relies on this service [1] [3].
                                    If stopped, your devices will not be able to download and install latest updates [1].

                                    Turning off this service can affect the update process and might cause issues like freezing during update scanning [3].

                                    This service runs continuously in the background and maintains Windows Update components [1] [2] [3].

                                    Disabling this service prevents it from reverting your Windows Update settings, such as re-enabling
                                    automatic updates without your permission [4].
                                    This gives you more control over your system's update behavior and settings.

                                    This script enhances your privacy by reducing data transmission to Microsoft related to Windows
                                    Update processes.

                                    Disabling the service improves system performance by eliminating a background process.

                                    However, this can affect system stability and update reliability over time.
                                    It may lead to update failures or incomplete updates.
                                    As a result, you may miss critical security updates, potentially exposing your system to security
                                    vulnerabilities.

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > Disabling this service may stop Windows from automatically fixing update issues.
                                    > This may lead to update failures or security vulnerabilities if updates are not managed manually.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    This script disables the `upfc.exe` process, preventing it from automatically re-enabling Windows updates [5].

                                    `upfc.exe` is found at `%SYSTEMROOT%\System32\upfc.exe` [1] [2].
                                    This executable is identified by Microsoft as "Updateability From SCM" [1] [2].
                                    SCM refers to the "Service Control Manager (SCM)", a special system process also known as `services.exe` [3].
                                    `upfc.exe` is automatically launched by SCM during system startup [4].
                                    It is part of the Windows Update self-healing mechanism [1].

                                    It recovers Windows Update Medic Service (`WaaSMedicSvc`) once disabled [1] [5].
                                    `upfc.exe` operates early in the boot process and performs several functions [1]:

                                    1. It checks the details of the `WaaSMedicSvc` against a configuration file, ensuring the service's settings match those listed [1].
                                    2. If discrepancies are found, such as invalid registry settings, `upfc.exe` recreates the service according to the XML configuration file [1].

                                    However, `upfc.exe` also sends data about its operations to Microsoft [1] [5], including details about discrepancies found and any corrective
                                    actions taken [1] [5]. This data is part of the telemetry Microsoft collects [1], which raises privacy concerns.

                                    This script will skip some of its disabling logic on older Windows versions due to community reports of disabling this service causing
                                    BSOD (blue screen of death) [5] [6].

                                    > **Caution:** By disabling `upfc.exe`, this script enhances user privacy by stopping the automatic sending of operational data to Microsoft.
                                    > However, it's important to note that this might impact the integrity and security of the Windows Update process. Users should weigh the
                                    > privacy benefits against potential security risks before using this script.

                        docs: |-
                            This category includes scripts to disable scheduled tasks that are associated with the automatic functioning of the Windows Update service.
                            These tasks are responsible for various background update-related activities such as checking for updates, downloading, and installing them
                            in the background without user intervention.

                            Disabling these tasks grants users more control over when and how updates are applied. This approach is often preferred by those wishing to
                            manually manage updates or avoid unanticipated system modifications without consent, and it is considered a best practice in high-security
                            environments where precise control over updates is crucial. However, it's important to exercise caution with these changes. Disabling automatic
                            updates can lead to missed critical security patches and feature updates, potentially leaving the system vulnerable.

                            To view all the scheduled tasks related to Windows Update, you can use the following PowerShell command:

                            ```powershell
                            @('\Microsoft\Windows\UpdateOrchestrator\*', '\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\*', '\Microsoft\Windows\WaaSMedic\*', '\Microsoft\Windows\InstallService\*') `
                                | ForEach-Object { Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName '*' -TaskPath $_ -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue } `
                                | ForEach-Object { Write-Host "$($_.TaskPath)$($_.TaskName)" }
                            ```

                                    Microsoft suggests disabling this task as a measure to reduce data collection and improve performance [2].
                                    This recommendation is also supported by Citrix for optimization purposes [3].

                                    This script disables the `PerformRemediation` scheduled task in Windows.

                                    This task performs recovery actions for update-related services to ensure they run in a supported configuration.

                                    Disabling this task enhances privacy by reducing automatic system changes and limiting data collection related to updates.
                                    It enhances control over system settings, letting users manage update configuration tasks without being overridden by the system.
                                    It improves performance by preventing unnecessary background processes.
                                    Microsoft recommends disabling this task in certain environments to minimize data collection and improve performance [1].

                                    However, disabling this task may interfere with Windows' ability to fix update-related issues automatically, possibly
                                    causing future update problems.

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > Disabling this task may prevent Windows from automatically resolving update-related problems,
                                    > which may affect system stability and security over time.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    The `PerformRemediation` task is part of the **Windows Update Medic Service** [2].
                                    It can restart the Windows Update Medic Service even if the service is manually disabled [3].
                                    The task is located at `\Microsoft\Windows\WaaSMedic\PerformRemediation` [2].

                                    It postpones both feature and quality updates in Windows 10 and Windows 11.
                                    This is particularly useful for those preferring fewer interruptions from regular updates.

                                    By default, the following registry keys are absent in Windows 10 and Windows 11 and are added only when updates are
                                    paused through the user interface [1]:

                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UX\Settings!PauseFeatureUpdatesStartTime`
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UX\Settings!PauseFeatureUpdatesEndTime`
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UX\Settings!PauseQualityUpdatesStartTime`
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UX\Settings!PauseQualityUpdatesEndTime`
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UX\Settings!PauseUpdatesStartTime` (set only in Windows 11 22H2 and later)
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UX\Settings!PauseUpdatesExpiryTime`

                                    This method has been tested and verified on Windows 10 from version 22H2 and Windows 11 from version 23H2 onwards.
                                    To ensure functional integrity, all these keys must be added together.

                                    While beneficial for Windows Home users [1], note that Group Policy Object (GPO) settings might override these changes.

                                    This script provides control over when and how often Windows feature updates and preview builds occur.
                                    These updates bring major changes to the operating system, affecting functionality and user privacy [1] [2].

                                    Key aspects of Windows feature updates include:

                                    - Protecting against behavioral issues [1].
                                    - Adding new features [1].

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > - This script postpones critical security updates, increasing potential security risks for your computer.

                                    >   to resume them there.

                                    ### Registry keys

                                    The script modifies various Group Policy (GPO), state, and Mobile Device Management (MDM) keys.

                                    Group Policy (GPO) keys:

                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate!Pause`:
                                        Used for pausing updates in older Windows 10 versions [5].
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate!PauseFeatureUpdates`:
                                        Obsolete key that only applies to Windows 10 version 1607 [5].
                                        Setting value `1` pauses feature updates and leaving absent or setting another value does not [5].
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate!PauseFeatureUpdatesStartTime`:
                                        Sets the start date for pausing feature updates [3].
                                        It is specified in a date format (yyyy-mm-dd, e.g., 2018-10-28) [4].
                                        This key supersedes the now-obsolete Windows 10 ver!sion 1607 key: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate!PauseFeatureUpdates` [5].
                                        This setting has been available since Windows 10 1703 [4].
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate!PauseFeatureUpdatesPeriodInDays`:
                                        Specifies the pause duration for feature updates [6].
                                        The range is from 0 (default) to 365 days [6].
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate!DeferFeatureUpdates`:
                                        Enables pausing of feature updates and activates `PauseFeatureUpdatesPeriodInDays` [5].
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate!DeferFeatureUpdatesPeriodInDays`:
                                        Allows pausing of feature updates for a specified number of days [4] [5] [7].
                                        It ranges from 0 to 365 days [5] [7].
                                        This key supersedes the now-obsolete Windows 10 version 1511 key: `HKLM\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate!DeferUpgradePeriod` [4] [5].

                                    State keys:

                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UpdatePolicy\Settings!PausedFeatureStatus`:
                                        Shows the current status of feature update pause [5].
                                        `0` means feature updates not paused, `1` means feature updates paused, `2` means feature updates have auto-resumed after being paused [5].
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UpdatePolicy\PolicyState!DeferFeatureUpdates`
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UpdatePolicy\PolicyState!FeatureUpdatesPaused`
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UpdatePolicy\Settings!PausedFeatureDate`:
                                        Records the date when feature updates were paused [5].
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UpdatePolicy\PolicyState!PauseFeatureUpdatesStartTime`

                                    MDM (PolicyManager) keys:

                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PolicyManager\default\Update\Pause!value`:
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PolicyManager\default\Update\PauseFeatureUpdates!value`:
                                        Manages pausing of feature updates for Windows 10, version 1607 or later [4].
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PolicyManager\default\Update\PauseFeatureUpdatesStartTime!value`:
                                        Specifies the start time for pausing feature updates [3] [4].
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PolicyManager\default\Update\DeferFeatureUpdatesPeriodInDays!value`:
                                        Sets the deferral period for feature updates [4].
                                    - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PolicyManager\default\Update\ConfigureDeadlineForFeatureUpdates!value`:
                                        Determines the deadline for automatic feature update installation [4].
                                        The maximum value is limited to 30 days [4].

                                    This script extends the time between mandatory quality updates, which include security patches [1] [2].
                                    Delaying these updates helps prevent frequent system reboots and disruptions, aiding productivity
                                    in professional and critical settings.

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > - This script postpones critical security updates, increasing potential security risks for your computer.
                                    > - This script disables the option to resume updates through the settings interface.
                                    >   The update settings will display "Your organization paused some updates for this device", and you won't be able
                                    >   to resume them there.

                    These scripts configures Attachment Manager included in Windows that takes further actions for
                    files that you receive or download such as storing classification metadata and notifying other software [1].

                        docs: |-
                            This script disables marking file attachments by using their zone information.

                            The default behavior is for Windows to mark file attachments with their zone information [1].
                            The zone information of the origin describe whether the file was downloaded from internet,
                            intranet, local, or restricted zone [1].

                            It is used by Attachment Manager that is included in Windows to help protect the computer from
                            unsafe attachments that can be received with e-mail message or downloaded from Internet [2].
                            If the Attachment Manager identifies an attachment that might be unsafe, it prevents you from
                            opening the file, or it warns you before you open the file [2].

                            Preventing this information to be saved:
                            - Increases privacy by no longer leaking information of source.
                            - Decreases security by preventing Windows to determine risks and take risk-based actions [1].
                            By not preserving the zone information, Windows cannot make proper risk assessments [3].
                            Disabling it has **Significant** criticality as the configuration introduces additional attack
                            surface according to US government [4].

                            The Attachment Manager feature warns users when opening or executing files which are marked as
                            being from an untrusted source, unless/until the file's zone information has been removed via
                            the "Unblock" button on the file's properties or via a separate tool such as
                            [Microsoft Sysinternals Streams](https://web.archive.org/web/20240314125039/https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/streams) [4].

                            It is configured using `SaveZoneInformation` value in
                            `\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Attachments\` registry subkey [1] [2] [3] [4].

                            The value is this setting is confusing, according to Microsoft documentation
                            `1` turns it on [2] [3], `2` turns it off [2] [3]. However, according to STIG V-63841, `1` disables
                            saving zone information and `2` enables it [3]. According to my tests, the STIG interprets it right
                            and `1` disables this function off.

                            In clean Windows 10 and 11 installations, this key by default is missing for both `HKCU` and `HKLM`.

                            This script prevents Windows from sending file attachments to antivirus programs for scanning when opened [1] [2].

                            Windows registered antivirus programs for downloaded files from Internet or through e-mail attachments [1].
                            If multiple programs are registered, they will all be notified [1] [3].
                            This is disabled by default, so even if you do not configure run this script, Windows does not call the registered
                            antivirus programs when file attachments are opened [1].

                            If it is enabled, Windows blocks file from being opened when antivirus program fails [1].
                            It is the recommended setting by Microsoft [1].

                            Preventing calling antivirus:

                            - Increases privacy by not sharing your file data proactively with installed antiviruses.
                            - Decreases by detecting and mitigating potential malicious software. Disabling it has **Moderate**
                              criticality as it is not an appropriate antivirus configuration according to US government [4].

                            An updated antivirus program must be installed for this policy setting to function properly [4].

                            It is configured using `ScanWithAntiVirus` value in
                            `\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Attachments\` registry subkey [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].
                            `3` enables the scans [1] [2] [3], `1` disables it [1] [3], and `2` leaves it optional [1].

                            In clean Windows 10 and 11 installations, this key by default comes with `3` value in

                docs: |-
                    This script commands your system to deactivate the hibernation feature. Hibernate is a power-saving state that saves your current work and turns
                    off the computer [1]. When your computer hibernates, it saves the contents of its RAM to your hard disk and powers off the machine [2]. Upon starting
                    again, your computer can restore all the open programs and documents from your hard disk to its RAM [1].

                    If hibernation mode is enabled, sensitive data stored in RAM are be written to disk [2]. The memory can contain private data, passwords, keys and so
                    on. This could be accessed by malicious software or people with physical access to the computer. By disabling hibernation, this script reduces the risk

                docs: |- # refactor-with-variables: Same • Quick Access Productivity
                    This category includes scripts to hide specific folders from **This PC** in **File Explorer**
                    and other file selection dialogs on Windows systems.

                    It enhances privacy by hiding personal folders from common Windows interfaces.
                    This prevents accidental exposure of sensitive information when sharing your screen
                    or allowing others to use your computer.

                    Removing folders may change how you access them if you often use **This PC** or file dialogs.
                    You can still reach these folders through direct paths or shortcuts.

                    These scripts are not applicable to Windows 11, as it does not display user folders
                    such as *Documents*, *Pictures*, and *Music* in **This PC** by default [1].

                    > **Caution**: This action enhances privacy but may require extra steps for access.

                    ### Folder Class Identifier (CLSID) Reference

                    Certain special folders within Windows are identified by unique strings called CLSIDs [3].

                    They include:

                    | Name | Internal Name | GUID |
                    |---------|---------------|------|
                    | Desktop | `CLSID_ThisPCDesktopRegFolder` | `B4BFCC3A-DB2C-424C-B029-7FE99A87C641` |
                    | Music | `CLSID_ThisPCMyMusicRegFolder` | `1CF1260C-4DD0-4ebb-811F-33C572699FDE` |
                    | Downloads | `CLSID_ThisPCDownloadsRegFolder` | `374DE290-123F-4565-9164-39C4925E467B` |
                    | Pictures | `CLSID_ThisPCMyPicturesRegFolder` | `3ADD1653-EB32-4cb0-BBD7-DFA0ABB5ACCA` |
                    | Videos | `CLSID_ThisPCMyVideosRegFolder` | `A0953C92-50DC-43bf-BE83-3742FED03C9C` |
                    | Documents | `CLSID_ThisPCDocumentsRegFolder` | `A8CDFF1C-4878-43be-B5FD-F8091C1C60D0` |
                    | Local Downloads | `CLSID_ThisPCLocalDownloadsRegFolder` | `088e3905-0323-4b02-9826-5d99428e115f` |
                    | Local Pictures | `CLSID_ThisPCLocalPicturesRegFolder` | `24ad3ad4-a569-4530-98e1-ab02f9417aa8` |
                    | Local Music | `CLSID_ThisPCLocalMusicRegFolder` | `3dfdf296-dbec-4fb4-81d1-6a3438bcf4de` |
                    | Local Videos | `CLSID_ThisPCLocalVideosRegFolder` | `f86fa3ab-70d2-4fc7-9c99-fcbf05467f3a` |
                    | Local Documents | `CLSID_ThisPCLocalDocumentsRegFolder` | `d3162b92-9365-467a-956b-92703aca08af` |

                    These CLSIDs can be inspected by running the following command.
                    The command displays their internal name as the default value on Windows 11 but not on Windows 10:

                    ```powershell
                    $registryPath = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\NameSpace"
                    $subkeys = Get-ChildItem -Path $registryPath
                    foreach ($key in $subkeys) {
                        # Get the key name (GUID)
                        $keyName = $key.PSChildName
                        # Get the (Default) value
                        $defaultValue = (Get-ItemProperty -Path $key.PSPath -Name "(default)" -ErrorAction Ignore)."(default)"
                        # Output the results
                        Write-Output "Key: $keyName"
                        Write-Output "Default Value: $defaultValue"
                        Write-Output "------------------------"
                    }
                    ```

                    You can open a folder with CLSID using the following command:

                    ```batchfile
                    start shell:::{CLSID}
                    ```

                        docs: |- # refactor-with-variables: Same • Quick Access Productivity
                            This script hides the **Desktop** folder from **This PC** in **File Explorer**.
                            
                            It improves privacy by hiding desktop contents, which often include personal files,
                            shortcuts, and temporary items.
                            This reduces the risk of accidentally revealing sensitive information when using
                            file dialogs.

                            However, this may impact your workflow if you frequently access desktop items this way.
                            The desktop remains visible and accessible by minimizing windows or using **File Explorer**.

                            This script hides the folder using these identifiers:

                            - Folder ID `B4BFCC3A-DB2C-424C-B029-7FE99A87C641` [1].
                            - CLSID `B4BFCC3A-DB2C-424C-B029-7FE99A87C641` [2].

                            On Windows 11, this script aligns with the system's default settings, as user folders
                            in **This PC** are hidden by default [3].

                            > **Caution**: This action enhances privacy but may require extra steps for access.

                            This script hides the **Documents** folder from **This PC** in **File Explorer**.

                            It enhances privacy by hiding the **Documents** folder, which often contains personal and
                            sensitive files.
                            This action reduces the risk of accidental exposure of private information during common
                            file operations or when others briefly access your computer.

                            This change may disrupt your workflow if you often access files in the **Documents** folder
                            via these interfaces.
                            You can still access the **Documents** folder directly in **File Explorer** or via
                            application-specific **Open** and **Save** dialogs that do not use **This PC**.

                            This script hides the folder using these identifiers:

                            - Folder ID `f42ee2d3-909f-4907-8871-4c22fc0bf756` [1].

                            On Windows 11, this script aligns with the system's default settings, as user folders

                            This script hides the **Downloads** folder from **This PC** in **File Explorer**.

                            It enhances privacy by concealing your downloaded files from casual view, potentially
                            including sensitive documents, personal data, or temporary items.
                            This reduces the risk of unintentional exposure of potentially private information when
                            using common file dialogs.

                            However, this may affect your workflow if you frequently access downloaded
                            files through these interfaces. The **Downloads** folder remains accessible
                            through direct navigation in **File Explorer** or web browsers.

                            This script hides the folder using these identifiers:

                            - Folder ID `7d83ee9b-2244-4e70-b1f5-5393042af1e4` [1].

                            On Windows 11, this script aligns with the system's default settings, as user folders
                            in **This PC** are hidden by default [4].

                            > **Caution**: This action enhances privacy but may require extra steps for access.

                            This script improves privacy as this folder may contain personal projects or designs.
                            This action reduces the risk of unintentional sharing of potentially sensitive 3D
                            models or related files.

                            Microsoft removed this folder in Windows 10 Build 21322 and later versions [1].

                            If you often use the **3D Objects** folder, this change may affect your workflow.
                            The folder remains accessible through direct navigation in **File Explorer**.

                            This script hides the folder using these identifiers:

                            On Windows 11, this script aligns with the system's default settings, as user folders
                            in **This PC** are hidden by default [5].

                category: Remove Windows apps
                docs: |-
                    This category covers the uninstallation of Windows apps.

                    Windows apps were introduced with Windows 8 and are typically acquired and installed through the Store app [1].
                    Many of these apps come pre-installed on Windows by default [1].

                    Uninstalling unused or unwanted apps contributes to privacy by reducing potential data collection points and minimizing your digital footprint.

                    The applications are categorized as:

                    - **Installed**: Included with the OS installation [1] [2]. They are stored in the `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\{PackageFullName}` directory [1].
                    - **Provisioned**: Added when you log in with a new user account for the first time [1] [2] [3].
                    They are located in `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\{PackageFullName}` [1].
                    Following PowerShell command can be used to view all provisioned apps:
                    `Get-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online | Format-Table DisplayName, PackageName, PublisherId` [3].
                    - **System apps**: Integral components of Windows [1] [2].

                    This category does not target framework apps. Framework apps are packages that get installed automatically if another application requires them [2]. If there are
                    applications depending on these framework packages, you cannot delete the framework app individually [2]. However, if you remove those dependent applications, the
                    associated framework package will be deleted [4]. To list all framework apps, you can use the following command:
                    `Get-AppxPackage | Where-Object { $_.IsFramework -eq $true } | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Name`.

                            This script uninstalls the "App Connector" Windows app.

                            The App Connector app accesses elements like your location, camera, contacts, and calendars [1] [2] [3].
                            This raises some concerns about user privacy [2].

                            In simpler terms, the App Connector acts as a bridge, facilitating communication
                            between Microsoft services and other apps over the Internet [2] [4] [5]. It's primarily aimed at developers, enabling them to connect with
                            Microsoft cloud services, such as Azure, or with other internet-based applications [4]. It's essentially a means to allow services to interact with tools
                            like Microsoft Power Automate, Microsoft Power Apps, and Azure Logic Apps [4]. Common services that can be connected using this include Salesforce,
                            Office 365, Twitter, Dropbox, and Google services [4].

                            To secure these connections, connectors typically use OAuth or usernames and passwords [5].

                            This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [6]. It was last seen on Windows 10 1511.

                            This category provides scripts for uninstalling pre-installed 3D modeling applications from Windows.

                            3D modeling applications allow users to create, visualize, and manipulate three-dimensional objects in a virtual space.
                            They are particularly useful for designers, artists, and professionals who need to create 3D designs for various purposes.

                            These apps, while useful for certain users, might not be required by everyone, thus providing the option to uninstall them.

                                name: Remove insecure "Print 3D" app
                                recommend: standard # Deprecated application with known security vulnerabilities; removal does not impact essential system functionality
                                docs: |-
                                    This script uninstalls the "Print 3D" application.

                                    This app enhances 3D printing by supporting network printers, optimizing settings, and rendering objects realistically [1].

                                    However, this app poses certain risks.
                                    The application can access the Internet, home or work networksm and your 3D objects [1].
                                    It has known serious security vulnerabilities such as "Remote Code Execution Vulnerability" [2].
                                    These vulnerabilities allow attackers to remotely execute malicious code on your system.
                                    This app is no longer supported [3], and Microsoft does not plan to issue patches [2].

                                    Removing this app mitigates security risks, enhances privacy by reducing data exposure,
                                    and frees up system resources, potentially improving performance.

                                    Microsoft has deprecated the "Print 3D" app in favor of the "Microsoft 3D Builder" app [3].
                                    It is recommended to upgrade to this newer application for ongoing support and features.

                                    This script removes both the legacy `Windows.Print3D` and the current `Microsoft.Print3D` packages from your system.
                                    `Windows.Print3D` package name is changed to `Microsoft.Print3D` since Windows 1903 [4].

                                    This script uninstalls the "Microsoft 3D Builder" app.

                                    Microsoft 3D Builder offers tools for creating, viewing, and printing 3D objects [1].
                                    It supports editing various 3D file types with features like material rendering, texture layering, 
                                    and includes tools to prepare models for 3D printing [1].

                                    This app succeeded the older "Print 3D" app as the default 3D printing software starting with the Windows 10 version 19H1 [2].

                                    This application uses your webcam, microphone, and internet connection [1], posing privacy risks due to potential data exposure.
                                    Uninstalling this app reduces privacy risks, frees up system resources, and minimizes the attack surface, thereby enhancing security.

                            This category includes scripts to uninstall MSN (sometimes branded as "Bing" or just "Microsoft") applications from Windows.

                            MSN apps come bundled with Windows and provide users with information from various domains such as weather, sports, news,
                            and finance. While they offer easy access to curated content right from the desktop, not all users find them essential.

                            If users prefer other sources or tools for this information, they might wish to uninstall these default apps to declutter their system.

                            This script removes the "Get Help" app.
                            This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1] [2] [3].

                            "Get Help" is an application designed to assist users with Windows-related issues [4]. It offers solutions through
                            troubleshooters, instant answers, and Microsoft support articles. It connects users with Microsoft support agents
                            and the Microsoft community for personalized assistance [4].

                            Removing "Get Help" not only supports a minimalist system approach but also helps reduce potential data collection.
                            Typically, support tools like "Get Help" gather diagnostic data and user interactions, which are used to improve service and
                            provide tailored support. By uninstalling this app, users can enhance their privacy by reducing their digital footprint.

                            However, removing "Get Help" disrupts some system support functionalities. For instance, the built-in internet
                            troubleshooting feature will cease to function [5]. Attempts to diagnose network problems from the system tray will result in

                            Extension apps are add-ons that enhance functionality related to media, images, and other software capabilities.

                            Many of these extensions come pre-installed on some Windows versions [1].
                            While they can be helpful, not everyone needs them.

                            Unused extensions can present security risks due to potential critical vulnerabilities [2] [3].
                            A critical vulnerability is a serious security risk that could allow attackers to gain full control of your system.
                            This risk is heightened because extensions usually have extensive access to the system.

                            By using these scripts, you can remove unnecessary extensions to improve your computer's security and lower the risk
                            of cyber attacks, a proactive measure for security and privacy.

                            > **Caution:** Uninstalling extensions could affect certain features, such as media playback or image processing.

                            This category focuses on scripts that help uninstall select Microsoft Office apps that may come pre-installed with Windows.

                            Microsoft Office suite is a popular productivity suite, providing tools for a wide range of tasks like document creation,
                            note-taking, and interactive presentation development. However, while many of these apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint are
                            commonly used, some other apps like My Office, OneNote, and Sway might not be essential for all users. Especially, if users have
                            other preferred tools or the web versions suit their needs better.

                            This category houses scripts dedicated to uninstalling specific applications related to the Microsoft Store.
                            As the digital storefront for Microsoft, the Microsoft Store is a hub for apps, games, movies, and other content.
                            While it provides a convenient method of obtaining software, some users might wish to uninstall or disable it for
                            reasons like performance optimization or data privacy concerns.

                            As always, when disabling or uninstalling core system apps, it is crucial to be informed of the potential repercussions
                            and act carefully.

                                    This script aims to uninstall the Microsoft Store app (also known as Store [1]).
                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1] [2] [3] [4].

                                    Microsoft has mentioned that it doesn't officially support the uninstallation of this app [4] [5]. Removing it might lead to unwanted
                                    effects [5].

                                    The Microsoft Store is subject to the data collection policies laid out in the Windows privacy statement [6]. It can collect diagnostic
                                    data about your device, its settings, and capabilities [7]. This data is sent to Microsoft and can include unique identifiers, potentially
                                    allowing Microsoft to recognize a user and their device [7]. Additionally, the data can offer insights into your device's settings,
                                    capabilities, health, visited websites, device activity (or usage), and, the memory state of your device [7]. Sometimes, this might
                                    inadvertently include parts of a file you are using [7].

                                    From a security perspective, the Microsoft Store increases potential risks, as it has known vulnerabilities [8].

                                    To address privacy and security concerns, it might be beneficial to disable the Microsoft Store and explore alternative methods for
                                    software package management. However, considering the official stance from Microsoft on uninstallation, it's important to understand that
                                    this action might affect some core functionalities of the operating system.

                                    This application provides TCUI functionality [1]. Title-callable UI (TCUI) is a feature that allows game code to invoke pre-defined

                                    Uninstalling this script can contribute to user privacy by removing unnecessary apps that may have predefined interfaces linked with
                                    Xbox Live, minimizing potential data interactions with the system.

                                    This app enables your PC games to connect to Xbox Live [1].
                                    Its removal can help prevent personal gaming data from being shared with Microsoft's servers.

                                    Running this script will impact:

                                    - Xbox sign-in for certain games, making it impossible to log in [2] [3] [4].
                                    - Log-in functionality for Xbox Game Pass, leading to errors and inability to access games [5] [6].
                                    - Log-in to the Xbox app itself [2] [4] [7] [8].

                                    Common errors caused by the absence of this app include:

                                    - "We tried to sign you in to your Microsoft Account, but something went wrong" [6].
                                    - "You are not signed in to Xbox Live" [6].
                                    - "We couldn't sign you in to Xbox Live. User Interaction is required for Authentication" [6].
                                    - "We can't sign you in right now. Try again later. (`0x406`)" [7] [8].

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [9] [10] [11] [12].

                                    This script uninstalls the "Xbox Speech To Text Overlay" app.

                                    The app offers a speech-to-text feature for certain Xbox games. Specifically, it turns spoken words during a party chat into text which then
                                    appears on the game screen [1]. This function is also termed as "game and chat transcription", and is compatible with games that support this feature [2].

                                    The removal of this app can help in reclaiming system resources and enhancing user privacy, as it would reduce the number of tools with potential voice
                                    data access. After uninstalling, the speech-to-text functionality in supported Xbox games may no longer be available.

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [3] [4] [5].

                            This category features scripts for managing Windows apps related to smartphones.
                            These scripts are for apps that connect smartphones to Windows, including dialer and other phone-related apps, even those that are outdated or replaced.
                            The scripts aim to let users control whether these apps stay or go, improving their control over personal settings.

                            These applications may pose privacy concerns due to their data sharing and synchronization capabilities.
                            Removing these apps improves privacy by stopping unwanted data sharing with Microsoft and reducing security risks.
                            This also improves system performance by reducing process count.

                            > **Caution:** Removal might affect smartphone integration features.
                            > Ensure you understand the implications and have alternative solutions if you rely on these features for your daily tasks.

                                    It provided setup instructions and syncing tips [1].
                                    The app enabled users to check their device's battery and storage status and transfer files [1].
                                    It supported Windows, Android, and iOS devices [1].

                                    This app has been absent in Windows versions since October 2018, replaced by the *Phone Link* app [3].
                                    Removing this app enhances privacy and system performance.

                                    > **Caution:** Removal may impact device synchronization on older Windows versions reliant on this app's unique features.

                                    Known technically as `Microsoft.YourPhone` [1] [2] [3],
                                    previously *Your Phone* [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] and *Your Phone Companion* [4].

                                    The app links your phone and Windows PC.
                                    It allows you to share and manage content and communications across devices [5] [7] [8].
                                    The app lets you text, make calls, use mobile apps, get notifications, and transfer files over Wi-Fi [5] [7] [8].

                                    Launched in October 2018 as *Your Phone* and *Your Phone Companion* [4],
                                    it was rebranded to *Microsoft Phone Link* in March 2022 [4] [9].
                                    Originally developed for Android [8], through collaboration between Microsoft and Samsung [8],
                                    it has extended support to iOS devices since April 26, 2023 [10].

                                    Privacy concerns arise from personal data handling, unencrypted data transfer, and potential misuse:

                                    - **No End-to-End Encryption:**
                                        It is not end-to-end encrypted, raising doubts about data privacy and security during transfers [11].
                                    - **Microsoft personal data collection:**
                                        Personal data, including text messages, clipboard contents, photos, and notifications, are collected by Microsoft [6].
                                        Microsoft confirms it stores and processes such data [6].
                                    - **Malicious Usage**:
                                        Misuse of the app, such as setting it up on a victim's phone to monitor communications without consent [12] [13], increases data leakage risks.
                                    - **Lack of Privacy Transparency:**
                                        The Microsoft Privacy Statement does not explicitly clarify that personal data is relayed through its servers, leading to possible
                                        misconceptions about data handling [6] [14].
                                        Microsoft's approach to privacy is criticized for lacking transparency [6] [11].
                                    - **Sensitive Information Exposure:**
                                        Data exposed to Microsoft, or can be received by an attacker can include sensitive information such as the content of private messages, security
                                        codes from authentication apps, caller identities, and more [6] [12].
                                        This can contain personal, financial, or security-related data [6] [12].
                                    - **Diagnostic Data Collection:**
                                        The app collects diagnostic data, including potentially sensitive information about app usage [6].
                                    - **Account Takeover:**
                                        The app could be used in account takeover attempts by intercepting multi-factor authentication notifications [12].
                                    - **Attack vector surface on Android:**
                                        Android devices face more potential attack vectors than iOS devices due to internet-based connectivity [12].

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [2] [3].

                                    This script removes the "Call" application, also known as the *Calling Shell App* [1].

                                    This app enables transferring and managing phone calls from a mobile to a Windows desktop, including playback
                                    through PC speakers [2].
                                    The main executable of this app is `CallingShellApp.exe`, which Microsoft describes as the
                                    "Calling App to host call progress on shell" [3].

                                    The script is safe to use if you don't need your PC to handle phone calls [3].

                        docs: |-
                            This category includes scripts for uninstalling default system apps in Windows.

                            System apps are pre-installed [1] [2] applications located in the `C:\Windows*` directory [1] [2].
                            These apps are typically found on `C:\Windows\SystemApps\{PackageFamilyName}` or `C:\Windows\{ShortAppName}` folders.

                            They are integral components of the Windows operating system [1].
                            Removing certain system apps may improve privacy by reducing data collection.
                            It can also improve system performance by freeing up system resources.

                            These scripts can make significant changes to your Windows system.
                            While these scripts aim to improve privacy, they may also affect system functionality.
                            These scripts remove several built-in Windows applications and modify system settings.
                            This can affect your system's behavior and potentially break certain features.
                            Removing certain apps or changing settings may disable features you rely on.
                            Apply only the changes you fully understand and need, rather than running all scripts indiscriminately.

                            To list all system apps:

                            1. Open a PowerShell command prompt.
                            2. Execute the following command: `Get-AppxPackage -PackageTypeFilter Main | ? { $_.SignatureKind -eq "System" } | Sort Name | Format-Table Name, PublisherId, InstallLocation`

                            > **Caution:** Uninstalling a system app may improve privacy but can also disable critical features and affect system functionality.

                            ### Excluded System apps

                            Some system apps are excluded from removal by privacy.sexy due to their critical role in OS functionality and lack of
                            documented privacy benefits.

                            #### Shell Experience Host (`Microsoft.Windows.ShellExperienceHost`)

                            It provides a windowed interface for universal apps [3] [4].
                            It is required for the desktop's visual elements, including transparency effects, Start Menu layout, desktop
                            background slideshow [5] [6].
                            Initially, it consumed significant CPU and memory resources, but subsequent optimizations have improved its
                            efficiency [3] [7].
                            Since the Windows 10 19H1, the Start menu has been managed separately from it to enhance reliability and
                            performance [8].
                            This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [9].

                            #### Start Menu Experience Host (`Microsoft.Windows.StartMenuExperienceHost`)

                            It handles hosting Windows Start menu [8].
                            Stopping or disabling the process removes Start menu functionality, causing live tiles to stop updating and
                            leading to other UI issues [10].
                            Disabling it makes the Start menu disappear [11].
                            Disabling leads to issues with Start Menu, Taskbar, and Action Center [12].
                            This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [9].

                            #### Windows Feature Experience Pack (`MicrosoftWindows.Client.Core`)

                            *Windows Feature Experience Pack* incorporates `MicrosoftWindows.Client.Core` as a store app [13].

                            Microsoft launched the *Windows Feature Experience Pack* to deliver feature enhancements independently
                            of the major Windows update cycles [14].
                            The aim is to expand the release schedule, with the ultimate goal of integrating these updates into
                            the regular Windows Update service [14].
                            This pack enables the development of specific features and functionalities independently [14].

                            The app is known to provide functionality for:

                            - Start menu [13] [15]
                            - Snipping tool [14] [15] [16]
                            - Taskbar (system tray) [13] [15] [17]
                            - File explorer functionality [15]
                            - Adaptive cards [15] (card layout [18])
                            - Split keyboard mode for the touch keyboard [14]

                            The package's functionality extends beyond these listed features.
                            Microsoft plans to add more features to this package [14].
                            According to tests, Microsoft includes new components in this package, such as `FREUserInterface`
                            and `VoiceAccessHost`, as observed in version 23H3.
                            This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [9].

                            #### Settings (`Windows.immersivecontrolpanel`)

                            This app provides the Settings interface [19] [20] [21] [22] [23].
                            This app replaced the Control Panel in older Windows versions [19] [21] [23].
                            Removing this app disables access to the Settings interface, preventing users from adjusting preferences,
                            configuring the operating system, and managing connected devices [21].
                            This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [9].

                            #### Windows Feature Experience Pack (`MicrosoftWindows.Client.CBS`)

                            This package, in combination with `MicrosoftWindows.Client.Core` [13], enables the **Windows Feature Experience Pack** [13] [24] [25] [27] [28] [29].

                            This app provides UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) features, independent of the main operating system [24] [25] [26] [27].
                            **CBS** in this package name means *Component-Based Servicing* [26] [30] [31] [32].
                            Microsoft uses it to update these UI/UX features independently of the core operating system, using different update cycles [24] [25] [26] [27] [30].

                            This package includes features such as:

                            - **System tray** features [13] [32]
                            - **Taskbar** features [13] [32]
                            - Text input features [24] [25] [29] [31] [33] (replacing older `InputApp` package [29] [31] [32] [33]) including:
                              - **Emoji picker** [24] [31] [33]
                              - **On-screen keyboard** [24] [31] [32] [33] [34]
                              - **Handwriting panel** [24] [32]
                            - Iris features [25] [29] [32]
                            - **Snip & Sketch** app [29] [35] (screen clipping [25] [29] [31] [32] [35])
                            - **Start Menu** [13] [25] [31] [32] [34] [35] [36]
                            - **Search** in taskbar/start menu (Cortana) [25] [32] [36]
                            - **Windows Backup** features [28] [37]
                            - **Web features** for store apps [25] [32]
                            - **Get Started** app [25] [32] [34]
                            - **News and Interests** widget [25]
                            - **File Explorer** functions such as icons [38]

                            Removing this package disables these functionalities [34], confirmed by tests.
                            To preserve these essential features, privacy.sexy does not remove this app.

                            This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [9].

                            ### File Explorer (Extensions) (`MicrosoftWindows.Client.FileExp`)

                            File Explorer (Extensions) is an experimental (canary) app from Microsoft for enhancing File Explorer [39].
                            This app is identified as `MicrosoftWindows.Client.FileExp` [39] [40] [41].

                            It adds new features to File Explorer, such as context menu enhancements, command
                            bar extensions, tabs, details pane, folder view, navigation content extensions [40].
                            It also introduces a Gallery view for some users [39] [41].

                            It uses **Windows App SDK** for the File Explorer [39] [41].
                            The Windows App SDK is a toolkit that simplifies the creation of Windows desktop apps by combining traditional
                            and modern development methods [42].

                            This app is part of Microsoft's effort to modularize Windows, separating system functions into individual
                            apps [39] [41]. 
                            This modularization allows for easier and quicker updates and improvements [39].

                            This app raises several privacy concerns:

                            - Data collection: This app includes telemetry features that collect data [40] [43].
                            - Telemetry: The app includes automatic data collection and transmission functions [40] [43].
                            - Consent by use: Using the app implies agreement to its data collection practices.

                            Tests confirm that deleting this app completely disables the File Explorer in Windows 11 23H2.
                            This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [9].

                                    - On-screen keyboard [8] [10]
                                    - Handwriting panel [8] [10]

                                    The app's main process is `WindowsInternal.ComposableShell.Experiences.TextInput.InputApp.exe` [1] [3] [5] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12].

                                    The app has been deprecated and replaced by the Windows Feature Experience Pack (`MicrosoftWindows.Client.CBS`) in newer Windows versions [12] [13].
                                    It's safe to remove this outdated app on modern systems.
                                    Removing this app improves privacy by reducing data processing by Microsoft and enhances system performance by lowering active processes.

                                    > **Caution**: Removing this app on older Windows versions (19H2 and earlier), disables key features like the on-screen keyboard,
                                    > touch support, and emoji dialog.

                                    This script uninstalls the "Microsoft AAD Broker Plugin" app. This app is also referred to as the "Work or school account" or "Broker plug-in" [1].
                                    The primary purpose of this app is to offer login functionality for what used to be Azure Active Directory and is now called Microsoft Entra ID [2].

                                    Users should be aware of the following side-effects before uninstalling:

                                    - For certain Windows versions, uninstalling this app disrupts the keyboard selection in the taskbar [3]. Clicking on the taskbar
                                    language selection icon will not show the selection dialog [3].
                                    - The Night Light feature, which adjusts the colors on your screen to reduce eye strain during the evening and night, will stop
                                    functioning after uninstalling [4]. You can read more about the Night Light feature
                                    [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20231003182409/https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/set-your-display-for-night-time-in-windows-18fe903a-e0a1-8326-4c68-fd23d7aaf136).
                                    - The authentication process for Office apps is affected, preventing users from signing in [5].

                                    Removing this app enhances user privacy by reducing potential data collection by the app. Yet, it's important to weigh
                                    the privacy benefits against the loss of the above functionalities.

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1] [6] [7].

                                docs: |-
                                    This category includes scripts to remove Microsoft Edge Legacy. Microsoft introduced the Legacy version based on the EdgeHTML
                                    engine [1] in 2015 [2]. However, as of March 9, 2021, they stopped supporting this version, implying it no longer gets
                                    security updates or patches [1] [2]. Keeping unsupported software on your system can pose security vulnerabilities.

                                    Initially, this version was the default browser on Windows 10 PCs [1]. Due to its tight integration with Windows, a simple uninstall
                                    might not eliminate all related files.

                                    One privacy concern with Microsoft Edge Legacy is how it handles your browsing history. When used, the browser integrates your browsing
                                    history into your device's activity log that is sent to Microsoft [3]. But, even if disabled, the data remains on your device [3].
                                    This local storage of data can be analyzed for your behavior, potentially compromising your privacy.

                                    By utilizing this script, you ensure a comprehensive removal of the browser and its related components, thus enhancing your system's
                                    privacy and security.

                                            This script uninstalls the "Microsoft Edge" Windows app.

                                            This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1] [2] [3].

                                            As of March 9, 2021, this app stopped receiving any updates or security patches [4]. Such unsupported software can become a security
                                            risk. Furthermore, using this version means your browsing data gets integrated into your device's activity history [5]. Microsoft can
                                            access this data [5] and it remains stored locally, leaving traces of your behavior [5].

                                            Removing this software not only minimizes potential security threats but also improves your privacy by preventing data accumulation.

                                            This script only applies to Edge (Legacy) and does not impact newer versions of Edge.

                                            This script removes the Developer Tools (DevTools) app that was paired with Microsoft Edge Legacy. These tools, now outdated, haven't
                                            received updates for a while [1] [2]. If the main Edge application is uninstalled, these tools lose their relevance and should be removed
                                            as well.

                                            This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [3] [4].

                                            Getting rid of such outdated software components helps to protect your security. They could have vulnerabilities waiting to be exploited. By uninstalling
                                            them, you're taking a step towards a more secure system.

                                        category: Remove Edge (Legacy) associations
                                        docs: |-
                                            This category removes file and URL associations from Microsoft Edge Legacy,
                                            to enhance privacy and potentially improve system stability and performance.

                                            Edge Legacy, though outdated, may still have associations on modern Windows versions.
                                            Removing these associations:

                                            - Reduces potential data collection through Edge Legacy
                                            - Prevents accidental use of an outdated browser
                                            - May improve system stability if Edge Legacy is removed
                                            - Can potentially enhance performance by eliminating unnecessary file associations

                                            This category applies only to Edge Legacy and does not affect newer versions of Microsoft Edge.

                                            If Edge Legacy associations remain after uninstallation, certain Windows functionalities may malfunction [1].
                                            Running this category improves system integrity, as standard uninstallation methods often leave these associations.

                                            On modern Windows versions (confirmed by tests since Windows 10 21H2 and Windows 11 21H2), Chromium-based Edge is
                                            associated with most default options (using ProgIDs such as `MSEdgePDF` and `MSEdgeHTM` [2]).
                                            However, some Legacy Edge associations may persist depending on the Windows version.

                                            ### Technical Details
                                            
                                            Edge Legacy is associated with several ProgIDs, each prefixed with `AppX` [3].
                                            Known ProgIDs include:

                                            - `AppX4hxtad77fbk3jkkeerkrm0ze94wjf3s9` [3] [4]
                                            - `AppXd4nrz8ff68srnhf9t5a8sbjyar1cr723` [3] [4]
                                            - `AppXq0fevzme2pys62n3e0fbqa7peapykr8v` [3] [4]
                                            - `AppX90nv6nhay5n6a98fnetv7tpk64pp35es` [3] [4]
                                            - `AppX7rm9drdg8sk7vqndwj3sdjw11x96jc0y` [4]
                                            - `AppX3xxs313wwkfjhythsb8q46xdsq8d2cvv` (Edge Holographic [4])

                                            File and URL associations can be found under these registry keys:

                                            - `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModel\Repository\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_{Version}\MicrosoftEdge\Capabilities\URLAssociations`
                                            - `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModel\Repository\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_{Version}\MicrosoftEdge\Capabilities\FileAssociations`
                                            
                                            Within these registry keys:

                                            - URL associations may include `http`, `https`, `microsoft-edge`, `microsoft-edge-holographic`.
                                            - File associations may include `.htm`, `.html`, `.pdf`, `.svg`.

                                            Not all these associations are present on every Windows system.
                                            The set of registered associations varies depending on Windows version and system configuration.

                                            > **Caution:**
                                            > Removing these associations can affect how certain files and URLs if you rely on Edge (Legacy).
                                            > Remember to set up an alternative browser to handle these file types and protocols.

                                            #### Open With Associations

                                            This category does not modify Open File Associations, as no such associations for Legacy Edge exist on
                                            latest Windows versions (confirmed by tests since Windows 10 19H1 and Windows 11 21H2).

                                            You can verify this by running the following PowerShell script:

                                            ```powershell

                                                    enhancing your privacy and potentially improving system performance.
                                                    
                                                    This script removes Edge Legacy from the default application selection dialog for certain file types and
                                                    protocols, preventing it from being easily chosen as the default handler.
                                                    Even on newer Windows computers, the old Edge might still be set to open common file types like:

                                                    - Web file formats (.htm, .html)
                                                    - PDF documents (.pdf)
                                                    - Web protocols (http, https)

                                                    Removing these connections:

                                                    - Reduces potential data collection through Edge Legacy
                                                    - Prevents accidental use of an outdated browser
                                                    - Improves system stability if Edge Legacy is removed [1]
                                                    - Can potentially enhance performance by eliminating unnecessary file associations

                                                    This script targets only Edge Legacy, leaving newer versions of Microsoft Edge unaffected.

                                                    > **Caution**:
                                                    > After running this script, Edge Legacy will no longer appear as a default program option for associated file types and URLs.
                                                    > Remember to set an alternative application to handle these.

                                                    The known associations by default are:

                                                    Certain associations, like `microsoft-edge` and `microsoft-edge-holographic` URL protocols, may be shared
                                                    between legacy and modern Edge versions.
                                                    The script removes shared associations only if they are explicitly linked to legacy Edge, preserving functionality
                                                    for newer Edge versions.

                                                    This script removes user associations for the legacy Microsoft Edge browser.
                                                    Even though these are user defaults, Windows includes Microsoft Edge (Legacy)
                                                    as the default browser for some associations on older versions of Windows.

                                                    It enhances privacy by preventing the legacy Edge browser from automatically opening
                                                    specific file types and URLs.
                                                    This helps reduce data collection and tracking by the legacy Edge browser.
                                                    If you have removed the legacy Edge browser, this script improves system stability by
                                                    removing orphaned file and URL associations.
                                                    It may improve system performance by preventing attempts to load non-existent legacy Edge
                                                    components when opening associated files or URLs.

                                                    The script applies only to Edge (Legacy) and does not affect newer versions of Edge.
                                                    It is relevant for older Windows versions, especially Windows 10 Pro 19H1 (1903).

                                                    > **Caution:**
                                                    > Removing these associations will prompt you to choose a default application the next time you
                                                    > open files or URLs previously associated with legacy Edge.
                                                    > Remember to set up an alternative browser.

                                                    ### Technical Details

                                                    On modern Windows versions (Windows 10 Pro ≥ 19H2 and Windows 11 Pro ≥ 21H2), there are no
                                                    user-chosen associations for Legacy Edge.
                                                    These associations were last observed on Windows 10 Pro 19H1 (1903).
                                                    They are not present in later Windows versions, with testing confirmed up to Windows 10 Pro 22H2 and Windows 11 Pro 23H2.

                                                    The script removes the following associations on Windows 19H1 (1903):

                                    This script uninstall the Microsoft Cloud Experience Host service.
                                    This service is required for connecting to corporate domains or Microsoft cloud-based services.
                                    It is also referred to as the "Microsoft account" app [1].
                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1] [2] [3].

                                    The Microsoft Cloud Experience Host has several functionalities:

                                    - It is responsible for connecting Microsoft accounts [4] [5].
                                    - It enables corporate login. Cloud Experience Host application comes into action during the joining process of workplace environments or Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) [6]. It renders the experience when collecting company-provided credentials [6]. After enrolling your device with your workplace environment or Azure AD, your organization can manage your PC and collect specific data about you, including your location [6]. The organization may add or remove apps, modify settings, disable certain features, prevent account removal, or even reset your PC [6].
                                    - It manages PIN, Biometric, and Device authentication [7]. This is needed for Windows Hello, which supports authentication through a device, biometric data, or a PIN code [7]. This functionality also assists in joining a machine to Azure AD or an on-premises AD domain [7].
                                    - Lastly, it aids in Out-of-box experience (OOBE) troubleshooting [8]. The OOBE comprises a series of screens such as the license agreement, internet connection, and login [9]. The service helps detect errors occurring during the OOBE flow [8].

                                    While the service does offer these essential functionalities, it also introduces notable privacy considerations.

                                    However, if one decides to uninstall it, they will encounter the following challenges:

                                    - The ability to sign in to Windows using a Microsoft account will be hampered, affecting cloud-based sign-in [10] [11].
                                    - The password and PIN sign-in options located in "Settings > Sign-in Options" will be inaccessible [12].

                                    This script uninstalls the "Content Delivery Manager" app.

                                    This app provides Windows Spotlight functionality [1], which automatically sets random wallpapers on the lock screen in Windows [2] [3].

                                    The main purpose of this app is to update the Windows experience [1].

                                    To achieve this, the app collects data about interactions with the Windows Spotlight content, such as which content is viewed,
                                    clicked on, or given feedback [1]. It records the content's ID, user actions, and other associated attributes [1]. Additionally, the app
                                    aggregates data about the state of content offers on a device, including the health of user accounts, the health status of the content
                                    delivery, and more specific metrics [1]. The app also keeps track of where the content is displayed, like on the LockScreen or Start menu,
                                    and when [1] [3]. This detailed tracking ensures that Windows stays up-to-date [1]. However, for users who prioritize privacy, understanding
                                    the data this app collects can be vital.

                                    The app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [4] [5].

                                    This script removes the "Search" app from Windows to improve privacy.

                                    The search app was previously known as `Microsoft.Windows.Cortana`.
                                    This app was commonly known as Cortana [1] [2] [3].
                                    It was pre-installed on older versions of Windows 10 [1] [2] [3].
                                    It collected personal data such as contacts, emails, calendar events, voice inputs, and searches [4].
                                    Cortana has been retired, with end-of-support reached in 2024 [5].

                                    `Microsoft.Windows.Search` is introduced in Windows 10 version 2004 [6].
                                    This app replaced Cortana's role in providing search functionality [6]
                                    Its executable, `SearchApp.exe`, is located at `C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.Search_cw5n1h2txyewy\SearchApp.exe` [7] [8].
                                    This app powers the Windows search bar [7] [8].
                                    Community reports suggest that this app may collect data to display advertisements [9] [10].

                                    Removing these apps enhances privacy by eliminating potential data collection.
                                    It improves security by reducing the attack surface.
                                    Additionally, removing these unnecessary apps may boost system performance by freeing up resources

                                    Removing these apps may cause the taskbar search to become unresponsive [11] [12], though File Explorer search remains functional.
                                    This has been confirmed on following versions on Windows:

                                    Due to these impacts, the script does not remove `Microsoft.Windows.Cortana` at all and removes `Microsoft.Windows.Search`
                                    on Windows versions where it's known that it has no impact.

                                    The "Windows Holographic First Run" app is a diagnostic tool on Windows, designed for potential users of Microsoft's Hololens, an augmented reality headset [1].
                                    When run, the app scans your computer's hardware to determine its compatibility with the Hololens [1]. It assesses which components meet or exceed the required
                                    specifications, which might offer a subpar experience, and which fail to meet the necessary standards [1]. The app accesses hardware data to ensure that
                                    the users have a system capable of supporting the Hololens [1].

                                    This app is pre-installed in specific Windows versions [2].

                                            This script uninstalls the "OOBE Network Connection Flow" app from Windows devices. The OOBE (Out-of-Box Experience) Network Connection Flow app assists
                                            users during their initial setup of a Windows device [1]. When setting up, users encounter the "Let's connect you to a network" screen, which lists available
                                            Wi-Fi and Cellular network options [1]. Devices with LTE capabilities and an active SIM card will automatically connect to the Cellular network, but if a Wi-Fi
                                            network is accessible, it will be preferred [1]. To ensure users don't consume excessive data during setup, Windows limits the download to essential updates
                                            when on metered networks [1].

                                            After establishing a network connection, the device starts downloading necessary driver and Windows Zero-Day Patch (ZDP) updates, which are necessary for device
                                            performance and security [1]. Users cannot opt-out of these updates [1]. If a newer Windows version is available and the device qualifies, users will get an option
                                            to download this update at the OOBE's conclusion [1].

                                            The primary process for this app is `OOBENetworkConnectionFlow.exe` [2].

                                    This script uninstalls the parental control app for Microsoft Family Safety.

                                    A **parental control** app helps parents regulate the content their children access online, including how long they spend on devices [1].
                                    It provides features such as content filtering, screen time limit enforcement, activity monitoring, contact blocking, and activity reports [1] [2].

                                    **Family Safety**, a specific parental control tool from Microsoft, lets parents monitor and control their children's online activities [3].
                                    It offers the ability to filter unsuitable web content and gives parents insight into the search terms their children use on search engines [3].
                                    One notable function is the "safe search" feature that communicates with search engines to ensure adult material is excluded from search results [3].

                                    However, using Family Safety means Microsoft collects personal details such as names, email addresses, birth dates, and other diagnostic data [4].
                                    There's a privacy concern, especially regarding minors, because the tool actively logs the search terms children enter into search engines [3].
                                    While "safe search" promotes user safety, it communicates settings to various search engine platforms, potentially sharing user preferences and
                                    identifiable information with these third parties [3]. It's also worth noting that certain browsers, like Firefox, require extra measures to
                                    ensure secure connections [3]. Without these measures, there's a risk of user data interception or manipulation.

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [5] [6].

                                    This app is also known as "People Hub" [1] [2] or "Windows My People" [3] [4].
                                    It allows users to pin contacts to the Windows task bar [3].
                                    Additionally, users can drag and drop documents, photos, or videos onto a contact to share them [3].

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1] [2].

                                    Its main operational file is `PeopleExperienceHost.exe`, which can typically be located at
                                    `C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.PeopleExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\PeopleExperienceHost.exe` [4]. This process is commonly as "Windows My People" [4].

                                    By uninstalling pre-installed apps like "My People", users can reclaim system resources and potentially enhance privacy by reducing the
                                    number of apps that could access and share their data.

                                    This script removes the Second Tile Experience app from your computer. The Second Tile Experience helps in providing a feature in Windows that lets users create quick access shortcuts,
                                    called secondary tiles, to specific content from an app on their Start menu [1]. For example, it might be a shortcut to the weather of a city or a favorite news article. Secondary
                                    tiles act as direct entry points to parts of an app, like displaying real-time updates or leading to a particular feature [1]. While these tiles share some similarities with primary tiles
                                    in terms of showing detailed content and notifications, they differ in a few ways. First, secondary tiles are created based on the user's choice, and they get a prompt from the system asking
                                    for confirmation before pinning [1]. Second, these tiles can be deleted at any time, and this doesn't affect the main app [1].

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [2].

                                    From a privacy perspective, it's worth noting that individual secondary tiles might track user behaviors or preferences, which could be a concern for some users.
                                    The purpose of this script is to offer users the option to uninstall this feature if they wish to prioritize their privacy.

                                    This script uninstalls the "Take a Test" application, also known as "secure assessment browser" [1] [2] [3]. It is a feature in Windows primarily used for online testing
                                    in schools [4]. The purpose of this app is to create a secure environment where students can't access external computer or internet resources while taking a test [4].
                                    It restricts specific activities, like printing, taking screenshots, or opening other apps [4]. The software offers two usage modes: a basic secure mode and a more
                                    stringent "kiosk mode" for vital assessments [4].

                                    Educators and administrators have the flexibility to set various rules using this application [5]. For example, they can determine if the test allows screen monitoring,
                                    if students can get keyboard text suggestions, or if a specific test should auto-launch when the app is started [5]. They can also control printing permissions and determine
                                    which user accounts are permitted to take the test [5].

                                    The app collects data such as the username of the person taking the test and information about the particular tests being taken [5].

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1] [2]. Its technical implementation can be found under the name `SecureAssessmentBrowser.exe` at
                                    `C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.SecureAssessmentBrowser_cw5n1h2txyewy\SecureAssessmentBrowser.exe`[3].

                                    Introduced in Windows 1511 (Windows 10 Fall Update) [1], this app allows users to share feedback with
                                    Microsoft, primarily aimed at Windows Insider users [1].
                                    
                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [2].

                                    Removing this app contributes to privacy by eliminating a channel through which user feedback and usage
                                    data might be sent to Microsoft. It's particularly useful for users who prefer to minimize data sharing

                                    This script removes the Camera Barcode Scanner app from Windows, enhancing privacy and security.

                                    The Camera Barcode Scanner app uses software to detect barcodes through your device's camera [1].
                                    A camera barcode scanner uses a standard camera lens with auto-focus and a software decoder,
                                    which Windows pairs dynamically to enable barcode scanning for Universal Windows Platform (UWP)
                                    apps [2].
                                    Digimarc Corporation provides this app [2].

                                    The `Windows.CBSPreview` system app [1] [3] and the
                                    `Microsoft-OneCore-PointOfService-CameraBarcodeScanner` Windows feature [1] include this app.

                                    Removing this app improves your privacy by:

                                    - Reducing potential data collection related to barcode scanning activities
                                    - Restricting the system's ability to process visual data from your camera

                                    It also enhances your security by:

                                    - Decreasing the attack surface for potential vulnerabilities in the barcode scanning software
                                    - Reducing the risk of unauthorized access to your camera for barcode scanning purposes

                                    Removing this app also improves system performance by:

                                    - Freeing up storage space
                                    - Reducing background processes related to barcode scanning capabilities

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [4] [5].

                                    This category includes scripts that remove applications providing printing-related user interfaces.
                                    These interfaces manage printing tasks from the desktop environment.
                                    Both system and third-party applications use these interfaces.

                                    Removing these apps benefits users who do not use physical printing or prefer alternative methods.
                                    This can streamline system operations and enhance security by reducing the attack surface.
                                    Additionally, removing these apps enhances your data privacy by preventing unauthorized printing of sensitive documents.

                                    However, removing these essential printing interfaces can disrupt normal printing functions for dependent applications.
                                    Users should assess whether these apps are essential to their workflow before removal.
                                    Do not run these scripts if you rely on the operating system's printing functionality.

                                    > **Caution:**
                                    > This may significantly impair your ability to print.

                                        docs: |- # refactor-with-variables: • Printing Caution
                                            This script removes the "Print Queue" app [1] [2] [3],
                                            also known as the *Print Queue Action Center* [1] [2] [3] [4] [5].

                                            This app replaces the older print queue dialog with a modern user interface (UI) [3] [5].
                                            It enables users to view and manage their print jobs, including pausing and resuming them [1] [2].

                                            The app first appeared in an early version of Windows 11 (build 22567.1) [5].
                                            It became fully functional in later updates (starting with build 22572.1) [3].
                                            The Windows 11 22H2 update includes it for general users [6].

                                            To determine if this app is essential for your workflow, launch it from the terminal using the following
                                            command to explore its features before deciding on its removal [1] [2]:

                                            ```

                                            ```

                                            This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [4] [2] [5] [3] [6].

                                            Uninstalling this app can improve system performance by reducing background processes.

                                            This script removes the "Print UI" system application.
                                            This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1] [2].

                                            First introduced in early development builds of Windows 10 [3] [4] [5], the "Print UI" app
                                            is crucial for the native printing experience in Windows. When users click the Print button in
                                            apps such as Photos or early versions of Edge browser (before Chromium), this UI is displayed [6] [7].
                                            Since the release of Windows 11 22H2, Microsoft has replaced the legacy print dialog for all
                                            classic apps (like Notepad and WordPad) with this newer interface [8].

                                            To determine if this app is essential for your workflow, launch it from the terminal using the following
                                            command to explore its features before deciding on its removal [3] [4] [5]:

                                            ```
                                            explorer.exe shell:AppsFolder\Windows.PrintDialog_cw5n1h2txyewy!Microsoft.Windows.PrintDialog
                                            ```

                                            The app is located at `C:\Windows\PrintDialog` [6] [7].

                                            Removing it may enhance system performance and security by reducing unnecessary components and the attack surface.
                                            It's safe to remove if you use applications that have their own printing dialogs or that directly request a
                                            different user interface from the operating system.

                                            However, applications like the Photos app, which depend on hard-coded calls to this UI, may lose printing
                                            functionality if the app is removed [6] [7].
                                            Therefore, it is advisable not to remove this app if you rely on such applications for printing.

                                            > **Caution**:
                                            > This may significantly impair your ability to print.
                                            > Removing this application may disrupt the ability of other apps to initiate printing tasks.

                                    other features to effectively use Narrator [4] [5].

                                    Narrator is a screen-reading tool built into Windows 11 and Windows 10, aiding users
                                    in tasks like using apps, browsing the web, and reading or authoring documents by
                                    reading text on the screen [6]. The script targets only the "Narrator QuickStart"
                                    tutorial, not the Narrator application itself.

                                    Besides removing the app, this script also disables the QuickStart by modifying the
                                    following the `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Narrator\QuickStart!SkipQuickStart` key [7] to protect
                                    the system integrity.

                                    Identified in testing, removing this app does not completely eleminate the tutorial.

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1] [2] [4].
                                    Introduced in Windows 10 [1] [2] [4], this feature has been part of the OS since version 1903 [2].

                                    > **Caution**: Removing this app may disable features in the tutorial for new users of the Narrator app,
                                    > This could impact the learning experience for new users of Narrator.
                                    > This script is recommended for users who are already familiar with Narrator, do not require the tutorial,
                                    > or will never use the Narrator feature.

                                    This script removes the GPU Eject Dialog app, enhancing the process of safely disconnecting external GPUs via Thunderbolt 3 [1].
                                    Like USB drives, this feature lets Windows safely unmount external GPUs.
                                    It provides the dialog to close any GPU-running applications to prevent data loss before detachment [1].

                                    The "GPU Eject Dialog" becomes visible when attempting to safely remove an external graphics card via the
                                    *Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media* icon [1].
                                    It shows applications using the external GPU, enabling their closure for safe detachment [1].

                                    It lists any applications actively using the external GPU, allowing users to close them and safely detach the GPU [1].
                                    If no applications are running, no dialog is shown, and the GPU can be safely removed [1].
                                    
                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1] [2].
                                    Introduced in Windows 10, this feature has been included since the Insider Preview Build 17623 [1].

                                    > **Caution**: While removing this app may not affect those without external GPUs, it could risk data and hardware safety for
                                    > users relying on external GPUs during disconnection.

                                    This script removes the "Windows Undocked Developer Kit (UDK)" app.
                                    This app is also known as `UndockedDevKit` [1], *Undocked Developer Kit* [2], *Undocked Dev Kit* [3], *Windows UDK* [2] [3], or *Undocked Shell* [4].
                                    It dynamically introduces new features and updates to the Windows desktop environment [4] [5], independent of full system updates [4].

                                    *Shell* encompasses the desktop interface elements, such as the *Start Menu*, *Taskbar*, and *File Explorer*.
                                    The UDK app makes it possible to update and customize these parts of the Windows Shell [4] [5] separately from the overall operating system [4].
                                    This modularity allows for quicker introduction of UI improvements or new features [4] [5] [6] without waiting for system-wide updates [4].

                                    It adds a plugin/hook system to File Explorer [4] [5].
                                    It allows the operating system to dynamically load different UI elements [4].
                                    It supports *shell hot swapping* [6] (also known as *Dynamic Shell Switching* [4]).
                                    This enables users to download new shells from the Store or switch between them on the fly [4].

                                    Benefits of removing this app include:

                                    - **Control Over Updates**: Users can better manage their system's functionalities by limiting access only to the features they use, enhancing security against unauthorized use or exploitation.
                                    - **Reduced Data Transmission**: This reduces the amount of data transmitted to and from Microsoft's update servers, lowering the risk of unintentional data exposure.
                                    - **System Optimization**: Eliminating the plugin system's overhead in File Explorer [6] may improve system performance [5] [6].
                                    - **Reduced Attack Surface**: Removing the app reduces potential vulnerabilities it may bring, thereby enhancing system security.

                                    This app comes pre-installed on certain versions of Windows [1].

                                    > **Caution**:
                                    > Removing the app may lead to:
                                    >   - Loss of functionality, impacting dynamic shell switching and quick iteration of design and code.
                                    >   - Delayed access to new shell components and features.
                                    >   - The possibility of unknown side effects, as this app is not documented officially by Microsoft.

                            This script deletes the OneDrive directory and all stored data from your profile.

                            OneDrive usually saves your data in the `%USERPROFILE%\OneDrive` directory [1] [2], also known as the *OneDrive folder*
                            or *OneDrive root directory* [2].
                            By default, OneDrive stores user data in folder called *OneDrive* [1].
                            For multiple accounts, files may be in *OneDrive - Personal* or *OneDrive - CompanyName* folders [1] [3].

                            OneDrive can synchronize default Windows folders like *Documents*, *Pictures*, *Music*, and *Desktop* [4] [5] [6] [7].
                            These folders are known as *user shell folders* [6] or *Windows system folders* [7].
                            Upon synchronization, these folders are moved within the OneDrive user data directory [5] [8].

                            Users may enable this synchronization unknowingly during Windows setup by choosing *Save files to OneDrive* option [9] [10].
                            Alternatively, synchronization can be enabled later through OneDrive settings [4]. OneDrive
                            may also prompt users to *set up protection of important folders* [11], a feature also referred to as *protect your folders* or *Known
                            Folder Move (KFM)* [11]. Additionally, an organization may move files of their managed computers to OneDrive using methods such as the
                            *Windows Folder Redirection Group Policy* [8].

                            This script contains safeguards to protect against unintended consequences:

                            1. **System Integrity Protection**:

                               The script verifies if any user shell folders are linked to the OneDrive directory.
                               This is crucial as redirecting these folders to OneDrive can cause system integrity issues.
                               For instance, if the *Desktop* folder is redirected to OneDrive, deleting the OneDrive folder could make the *Desktop* inaccessible.
                               The script stops and warns if any user shell folders are found within OneDrive.

                               > 💡 Move these folders back to their original locations using the
                               > `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders` registry key [6] before proceeding.

                            2. **Data Loss Prevention**:

                               The script avoids deleting files or non-empty directories to prevent accidental data loss.

                               > 💡 Manually empty these directories before running the script or opt to delete them afterward if needed.

                            The OneDrive folder has been confirmed to exist in modern versions of Windows, tested since Windows 11 (since 22H2)
                            and Windows 10 (since 22H2).

                            This script ensures the removal of all OneDrive shortcuts from your system, even after uninstallation or cleanup.

                            Erasing these shortcuts improves the security and privacy of your computer system, lessening the potential access points for
                            unwanted entities.

                            Moreover, the removal of unused shortcuts results in a more organized and efficient system, enhancing your user experience by
                            preventing any confusion from dead shortcuts.

                            Shortcuts that link to OneDrive are stored in various locations, such as:

                            - `Start Menu\Programs\Microsoft OneDrive.lnk`, `Start Menu\Programs\OneDrive.lnk`, `Links\OneDrive.lnk` [1],
                            - `ServiceProfiles\LocalService` and `ServiceProfiles\NetworkService` [1]

                            Below are the tested shortcut file locations on default installation (since Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 22H2):

                            | Path | Windows 11 | Windows 10 |
                            | ---- |:----------:|:----------:|
                            | `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\OneDrive.lnk` | ✅ Exists | ✅ Exists |
                            | `%USERPROFILE%\Links\OneDrive.lnk` | ❌ Missing | ❌ Missing |
                            | `%SYSTEMROOT%\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\OneDrive.lnk` | ❌ Missing | ✅ Exists |
                            | `%SYSTEMROOT%\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\OneDrive.lnk` | ❌ Missing | ✅ Exists |

                            In Windows 10 and higher, additional steps are necessary to delete the OneDrive icon from the navigation pane in Windows
                            Explorer [2], which is executed by this script.

                            - Windows Store apps from accessing OneDrive using the WinRT API.
                            - OneDrive from appearing in the navigation pane in File Explorer.

                            Setting `DisableFileSyncNGSC` group policy prevents OneDrive from working on both Windows 10 and 11 [1] [2].
                            Windows 8 uses older `DisableFileSync` key [3].

                            These policies do not exist by default in clean installations.

                            This script prevents OneDrive from automatically reinstalling itself.

                            OneDrive, Microsoft's cloud storage service, can automatically reinstall itself after being 
                            uninstalled on older Windows 10 versions [1].
                            This is done through a startup entry that runs `OneDriveSetup.exe`, which silently installs
                            OneDrive [2] when a user logs in [3].

                            The script enhances privacy by stopping OneDrive from reinstalling without user consent.
                            This prevents unwanted data collection and synchronization.
                            It also boosts system performance by preventing an unnecessary application from running
                            and using system resources.
                            Microsoft recommends this method for optimizing Windows [1].

                            This script deletes the `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run!OneDriveSetup`
                            registry key [1].
                            It specifically targets Windows 10 version 1909.
                            Modern versions of Windows 10 (20H2 and later) and Windows 11 do not have this automatic
                            reinstallation feature.

                            This script deletes the `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run!OneDriveSetup` key [1].

                        name: Disable OneDrive scheduled tasks

                        docs: |-
                            This script disables the scheduled tasks associated with Microsoft OneDrive that typically
                            run maintenance activities such as auto-updates [1] [2] [3] and data collection [2].
                            Disabling these tasks impacts OneDrive's automatic background update process [1] [2] [3].

                            By default, Windows 10 (since 22H2) and Windows 11 (since 22H2) include the following tasks:
                            - `OneDrive Standalone Update Task` [1] [2] [3]
                            - `OneDrive Reporting Task` [1]

                            These tasks are enabled by default and lack official documentation from Microsoft. They can be identified
                            by executing `Get-ScheduledTask 'OneDrive *' | Select -ExpandProperty TaskName` in PowerShell.
                            These tasks are observed to persist even after OneDrive is uninstalled.

                            The tasks appear with a Security Identifier (SID) unique to each installation [1], following this pattern:
                            - `OneDrive Reporting Task-S-1-5-21-xxxxxx`
                            - `OneDrive Standalone Update Task-S-1-5-21-xxxxxx`

                            The SID, denoted by 'xxxxxx', varies per installation and represents the user account associated with the task.
                            SID of user accounts always start with `S-1-5-21` [4], the rest of the number changes per user.
                            To see all user SIDs, you can run `wmic useraccount get Name,sid`.
                            The SID for your account can be confirmed using `whoami /user`.
                            A SID which doesn't correspond to any user account may appear.
                            This is be due to system preparation processes (`sysprep`) that use different SIDs for tasks to prevent duplication [5].

                            Disabling tasks with standard user SIDs is straightforward, but attempting to disable tasks with unpredictable SIDs can
                            result in an error message: `Catastrophic failure (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80000FFF (E_UNEXPECTED))`.

                            Nonetheless, disabling tasks with the correct SID is achievable using the provided script, which locates the full task names
                            including the SIDs.

                            If OneDrive is installed for all users on a machine (which is not the default behavior [6]), an additional task is present:
                            - `OneDrive Per-Machine Standalone Update` [1] [7].

                            Disabling the `OneDrive Standalone Update Task` is recommended by Microsoft to improve system performance and reduce
                            unnecessary data collection [2].

                category: Remove Edge
                docs: |-
                    This category automates the uninstallation of Microsoft Edge (also known as "Chromium Edge" or "New Edge" [1]), the web browser that comes
                    pre-installed with many versions of Windows.

                    Microsoft Edge collects various types of data, some of which pertain to your browsing habits, such as the websites you visit, your search
                    queries, and the data you enter into forms [2]. Additionally, it tracks usage metrics and diagnostic data about your device data and
                    how the browser is functioning [2]. These pieces of information could be used for targeted advertising or profiling. Removing Microsoft
                    Edge ensures that it is not silently accumulating this data in the background, thereby improving your overall privacy.

                    By default, Microsoft Edge doesn't allow uninstallation and has officially declared Microsoft Edge as uninstallable on Windows [3].

                        name: Remove Edge through official installer
                        docs: |-
                            This script uninstalls Microsoft Edge using the official installer.
                            This script reliably uninstalls Microsoft Edge, even when direct removal is restricted by system settings.

                            1. **Enable Uninstallation**:
                               The script modifies a registry key to permit the uninstallation of Microsoft Edge.
                               This step is required because from version 116 onwards, Edge cannot be uninstalled without setting this registry key [1].
                            2. **Mark Microsoft Edge (Legacy) as Installed**:
                               It creates a placeholder file to simulate the presence of the Legacy version of Microsoft Edge (Legacy).
                               This is necessary as the newer versions of the Edge installer check for Legacy Edge before allowing uninstallation [2].
                            3. **Run Uninstaller:**
                               The script finds and runs the Microsoft Edge installer (`setup.exe`) for each version of the browser installed on the system.
                               This guarantees the complete removal of all Microsoft Edge versions from the system [1].

                            **Note:** This script uses methods not officially documented but confirmed effective by community testing and support.

                        category: Remove Edge associations
                        docs: |-
                            This category removes Microsoft Edge browser associations from your Windows system,
                            enhancing privacy and system control.

                            These associations often remain after uninstalling Edge, potentially leading to unexpected behaviors and privacy concerns [1].

                            Removing these associations will:

                            - Preventi Edge from automatically handling various file types and web protocols
                            - Reduce potential data collection and tracking via Microsoft Edge
                            - Eliminate leftover settings that may cause system instability after uninstalling Edge [1]
                            - Potentially improve system performance by removing unnecessary file and protocol handlers

                            This category is recommended if you've decided not to use Edge or have uninstalled it.
                            This gives you full control over which applications handle your files and web protocols.

                            > **Caution:**
                            > This will change how your system handles various file types and web protocols.
                            > Remember to set up an alternative browser.

                            ### Technical Details

                            This category addresses associations found under specific registry keys:

                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Clients\StartMenuInternet\Microsoft Edge\Capabilities\FileAssociations`
                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Clients\StartMenuInternet\Microsoft Edge\Capabilities\URLAssociations`

                            The scripts remove associations for file types (like .htm, .html, .pdf, .svg), and protocols
                            such as (http, https, and ftp).

                            This category does not clear associations under `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Clients\StartMenuInternet` registry key.
                            Because default installer already clears these keys.

                                    This script prevents Microsoft Edge from being listed as a default program for various file types
                                    and web links in Windows, giving you control over which programs open your files and enhancing
                                    your privacy.

                                    It improves privacy by preventing Edge from appearing as an option when selecting programs
                                    to open certain files or web links.
                                    This increases user control and reduces data collection and tracking via Microsoft Edge.
                                    
                                    If you've uninstalled Edge, this script stabilizes your system by removing leftover associations [1].
                                    It may also boost performance by removing unnecessary Edge-related file and protocol handlers.

                                    > **Caution:**
                                    > After running this script, Edge will no longer appear as a default program for associated file types and URLs.
                                    > Remember to set up an alternative browser.

                                    ### Technical Details
                                    
                                    The script removes all Edge associations for web-related file types (e.g., .htm, .html, .pdf, .svg) and
                                    protocols (e.g., http, https, mailto) from the Windows registry.

                                    Tests confirm that these associations vary across Windows versions:

                                docs: |-
                                    This script removes Microsoft Edge associations from the **Open With** context menu
                                    for various file types.

                                    It enhances privacy by reducing Microsoft Edge's integration with the operating system.
                                    This limits data collection opportunities during file interactions.
                                    It also enhances system stability by removing leftover Edge associations after uninstalling
                                    the browser [1].
                                    It may improve system performance by simplifying the **Open With** menu.

                                    Removing these associations gives you control over which applications handle your files, thereby
                                    reducing unwanted data sharing with Microsoft.

                                    > **Caution:**
                                    > Removing these associations may change how certain file types and web links are handled on your system.
                                    > Remember to set up an alternative browser.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    The script targets file extensions such as `.htm`, `.html`, `.pdf`, and `.svg`, removing their
                                    associations with Microsoft Edge in the Windows Registry.
                                    These associations persist even after uninstalling Edge (last confirmed with Edge v115 on
                                    Windows 11 22H2 and Windows 10 21H1).

                                    The script applies to Windows 10 (version 1909 and later) and Windows 11.

                                name: Remove Edge user associations
                                docs: |-
                                    This script removes user-chosen Microsoft Edge associations for specific file types and web links.
                                    Even if a user does not explicitly choose Edge as the default browser, it is chosen by default.

                                    Edge associations often remain after uninstalling the browser [1].
                                    This can affect privacy and system performance.

                                    Removing these associations will:

                                    - Enhance privacy by reducing Microsoft Edge's presence in your system
                                    - Improve system stability, especially if Edge is uninstalled [1]
                                    - Boost performance by eliminating unnecessary file associations
                                    - Improve user control by allowing you to choose the browser you wish to use.

                                    Removing these associations allows you to choose which applications open.
                                    This enhances user control, privacy, system stability, and performance.

                                    > **Caution:**
                                    > Removing these associations will prompt you to choose a default application
                                    > the next time you open files or URL protocols previously associated with Edge.
                                    > Remember to set up an alternative browser.

                                    ### Technical Details

                                    The script affects various file types (such as .htm, .html) and web protocols (e.g., http, https, ftp).
                                    It deletes Edge associations from the Windows Registry that control the user-chosen associations.

                                    This action applies to Windows 10 versions from 1909 onward and all versions of Windows 11.
                                    Earlier Windows 10 versions (like 1903) do not have these specific Edge associations by default.

                                    The table below shows the availability of Edge associations across different Windows versions,
                                    confirmed by tests:

                            This script removes Microsoft Edge shortcuts from specific locations on your computer, enhancing the privacy and
                            integrity of your system.

                            When installed, Microsoft Edge, places shortcuts in various locations on your computer. Even after uninstalling the
                            Edge browser, some of these shortcuts may not be removed (tested since ≥ Edge v117). This script ensures the
                            removal of these residual shortcuts.

                            These shortcuts can serve as access points for malicious entities, potentially compromising your computer's security
                            and privacy. By deleting these shortcuts, the script helps in reducing these vulnerabilities, thus contributing to
                            a more secure and private computing environment.

                            Besides contributing to privacy and security, removing these unused shortcuts also contributes to a cleaner and more
                            organized computer system, providing an enhanced user experience.

                            The script specifically targets and removes shortcuts from the following paths, which have been tested and verified to
                            exist on default installations of Windows since Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 22H2:

                    Windows 11 adds a new taskbar flyout named "Widgets", which displays a panel with Microsoft Start, a news aggregator
                    with personalized stories and content (expanding upon the "news and interests" panel introduced in later builds of Windows 10) [1].
                    It's rebranding/future version of older "Windows 10 News and Interests" feature [2].
                    The user can customize the panel by adding or removing widgets, rearranging, resizing, and personalizing the content [1].

                    It has privacy implications as it collects data about your usage of the computer such as diagnostics data [3].

                            To control whether the Widgets button is visible on the taskbar, Microsoft introduced `TaskbarDa` registry value [1].
                            Possible `DWORD` 32-bit settings for the `TaskbarDa` value are [1] [2]:

                            1. 0 = Hidden
                            2. 1 = Visible

                            This registry key does not exist in Windows 11 installations by default.

                docs: |-
                    This category includes scripts to disable or remove the Windows Copilot feature.
                    "Windows Copilot" is also known as "Copilot in Windows" [1] [2] [3],

                    Windows Copilot is an AI assistant within Windows [1] [2].
                    It helps with a wide range of tasks, like adjusting system settings [1] [2].
                    It can deliver web results [1], and supports generating creative content, like images [1] [2],
                    and providing personalized suggestions based on user data analysis [2].

                    While these features enhance user experience, they raise privacy concerns due to the extensive personal
                    data access and processing involved, including user files [4], keyboard and voice inputs [3], and browser
                    history [3].
                    Such data is transmitted to Microsoft's servers [3].
                    Transmitting this data to Microsoft poses potential privacy and security risks.

                    Moreover, Copilot's susceptibility to attacks like prompt engineering underlines its security risks [5].
                    More about security vulnerabilities: [Attacks on language models](https://erkinekici.com/articles/attacks-on-language-models/).

                    Removing Windows Copilot reduces privacy and security risks, improves system performance, and simplifies
                    the user interface.

                            This script deactivates the Windows Copilot feature, enhancing user privacy and potentially improving system performance.
                            By default, Copilot is enabled and appears on the taskbar when available [1] [2].

                            Disabling Windows Copilot prevents it from appearing on the taskbar and stops it from functioning [1] [2].
                            This action is useful for users who prioritize privacy and system performance, as it eliminates a potential
                            channel for data sharing with Microsoft servers and reduces the attacks on language models [3]. 
                            Read more: [Attacks on language models](https://erkinekici.com/articles/attacks-on-language-models/).

                            The script operates by modifying two registry keys:

                            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsCopilot!TurnOffWindowsCopilot`:
                              This key disables Copilot for all users on the device [2] [4].
                            - `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsCopilot!TurnOffWindowsCopilot`:
                              This key disables Copilot for the current user [1] [4].

                            To fully disable Copilot, both machine-level (`HKLM`) and user-level (`HKCU`) settings might need
                            adjustment, given reports that `HKLM` alone is inadequate [4].

                            This script turns off Copilot, enhancing privacy by preventing data collection and transmission,
                            and improving security by reducing the risk of language model attacks [3].

                            This script disables Copilot access on your computer, enhancing your privacy.

                            It prevents the Copilot feature from activating or being suggested for use locally [1] [2].

                            When activated, Copilot can access and process a vast array of personal data, potentially leading to privacy concerns.
                            By setting your local user's eligibility status to "ineligible" this script effectively removes the possibility of Copilot
                            being automatically offered or activated on your system.

                            It works by adjusting the `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\Copilot\BingChat!IsUserEligible` registry key [1] [2] [3].
                            Typically, this key may be modified by Microsoft based on your account activity [3].
                            However, running this script will override such adjustments, maintaining your privacy preference and potentially
                            enhancing system performance by disabling background services.

                            Please restart your computer after applying this script to activate changes [2] [3].
                            If reverting, relog into your Microsoft account to reset settings [3].

                            This script stops the Copilot feature from automatically starting up with Windows,
                            providing a more controlled and resource-efficient computing experience.

                            With the release of Windows 11 builds 25992 (Canary) and 23615 (Dev), users encountered a new functionality
                            that would auto-launch Copilot on wider screens [1] [2] [3].

                            This script modifies the `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Notifications\Settings!AutoOpenCopilotLargeScreens`
                            registry key to configure this setting [1] [2].

                            This script ensures Copilot stays inactive at startup, activating only when the user initiates it manually.
                            This change not only respects user preference but also frees up system resources that would otherwise be consumed by this feature,
                            potentially leading to faster startup times and better overall performance.

                            Windows added a taskbar button enabled by default to launch Windows Copilot [1].
                            This feature was introduced with the Windows 11 22H2 Moments 4 update [2] [3].

                            The script configures the `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced!ShowCopilotButton`
                            registry key [3] [4].

                            This script will turn off the Copilot button in the Settings app of Windows 11, which will hide or remove
                            the Copilot icon from the taskbar [4].

                            Disabling the Copilot button won't uninstall the feature but will hide the icon from the taskbar, simplifying
                            the user interface and reducing distractions.

                            This action also reduces the visibility of a feature with privacy implications from data collection and processing.

                    This category contains scripts designed to enhance privacy by disabling system services that are not essential for your
                    operating system's core functions.

                    A Windows service is a program that runs in the background, automatically starting and operating without direct user
                    interaction, even when no user is logged in [1].

                    Disabling these services, especially those transmitting data to external parties or running unseen, significantly
                    reduces the risk of unwanted data exposure.

                    Taking these proactive steps is crucial for minimizing privacy risks and improving your system's security.

                            This script disables the **Microsoft Account Sign-in Assistant** (`wlidsvc`) service.
                            This service helps users sign in with their Microsoft account, giving access to Microsoft's services and apps [1] [2].

                            This service connects with Microsoft's cloud for authentication [3].
                            Formerly known as the "Microsoft Windows Live ID Service", it supported sign-ins for applications such as
                            Office and Windows Live Messenger [4].
                            Currently, it uses Microsoft Entra (formerly Azure AD [5]) as identity service [6] [7].
                            It's used to facilitate creation of primary identifier Microsoft use for devices [8]

                            Disabling this service prioritizes user privacy by limiting data sharing with Microsoft but necessitates a trade-off

                              user data.
                              This delivers both local and push notifications to your device [1].
                            - It may bypass VPN protections and expose your device's real IP address, according to
                              Wikipedia (uncited) [2].

                            Running this script will:

                            - Enhance your privacy by reducing data sent to Microsoft servers
                            - Improve security by limiting potential attack vectors
                            - Boost system performance by reducing background processes

                            > **Caution**:
                            > After running this script, you will no longer receive instant notifications from most apps.
                            > This may include important updates or messages.

                            ### Technical Details

                            This script disables two services:

                            1. `WpnService` (Windows Push Notifications System Service) [3]
                            2. `WpnUserService` (Windows Push Notifications User Service) [4]

                            Disabling `WpnUserService` may cause these issues:

                            - **Network & Internet** in Settings:
                              - Windows 10: May cause issues accessing network settings [5] [6] [7].
                              - Windows 11: No reported issues [5].
                              - To reproduce (Windows 10):
                                1. Open **Settings** 
                                2. Select **Network & Internet**
                            - **Notification Center** in taskbar:
                              - All Windows 11 versions:
                                - Prevents opening **Notification Center** [8] (known as *Action Center* on
                                  Windows 10 [9]) .
                                - The **Notification Center** (known as **notification area** on Windows 10 [10])
                                  is at the right end of the taskbar [11].
                                - It includes system status icons (e.g., date/time, battery, Wi-Fi) and
                                  notifications [8] [11].
                              - To reproduce (Windows 11): Click the **Notification Center** icon on the taskbar.
                            - **Notifications & Actions** in Settings:
                              - Some Windows 11 versions: Unable to access **Notifications & Actions** [12] on
                                Settings app.
                              - To reproduce (Windows 11):
                                1. Open **Settings**
                                2. Select **System**
                                3. Select **Notifications**

                            Confirmed side effects per Windows version after disabling `WpnUserService` and rebooting:

                            | Windows Version | Taskbar Notifications Center | Notifications & Actions Settings | Network Settings |
                            | --------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |------------------|
                            | Windows 11 23H2 | 🔴 Affected | 🔴 Affected | 🟢 Unaffected |

                            | Windows 10 20H2 | 🟢 Unaffected | 🟢 Unaffected | 🔴 Breaks |
                            | Windows 10 19H2 | 🟢 Unaffected | 🟢 Unaffected | 🟢 Unaffected |
                            | Windows 10 19H1 | 🟢 Unaffected | 🟢 Unaffected | 🟢 Unaffected |

                            Due to these issues, this script disables `WpnUserService` only on Windows 10 version 19H2 and earlier versions.

                            While enhancing gaming, these services may impact privacy and system performance for non-Xbox Live users.

                            Turning off these services protects privacy by stopping unnecessary data sharing with Xbox Live servers.

                                    Turning off this service can enhance privacy for users who do not use Xbox Live, as it prevents potentially
                                    unnecessary communication with Xbox Live servers.

                            This script disables the **Shadow Copy** service, known also as the
                            *Volume Shadow Copy Service* (VSS) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] or *Volume Snapshot Service* [4] [6].
                            This service is integral for system backups [1] [2] [3] [5] and data snapshots [1] [5] [7].
                            It allows for data recovery [1] [5] and system restore points [1] [7] [8].

                            Introduced with Windows Server 2003 [1], VSS facilitates backups and system restores without needing to take applications offline [1].
                            It creates a consistent snapshot of data for backup, supporting functions like archiving, data mining, and disk-to-disk backups [1].
                            These snapshots can restore data in case of data loss, to the original location or a new one, if the original has failed [1].

                            However, VSS has privacy and security risks:

                            - It can store unencrypted versions of files, even after users have encrypted and securely deleted them  [5] [7].
                            This feature, while useful for recovery, poses a risk as it allows retrieving deleted files,
                            undermining efforts to permanently remove sensitive information.
                            - Malware may use this service for persistence [4].
                            - Forensic investigators use shadow copies to recover deleted files and analyze your behavior [5].

                            Disabling VSS can also free up system resources and potentially improve performance by eliminating the creation and storage of shadow copies.
                            But it will render system restore points [1] [8] and Windows Backup [1] features inoperative, potentially compromising data recovery capabilities.
                            This trade-off between privacy/security and system recovery features should be carefully considered.

                            > **Caution**:
                            > Disabling this service will make shadow copies unavailable for backup, which could cause backup processes to fail [3].
                            > Services that depend on VSS will not start, affecting features like Windows Server Backup [1], Shadow Copies of Shared Folders [1],
                            > System Center Data Protection Manager [1], and System Restore [1] [8].

                category: Remove Snipping Tool
                docs: |-
                    This category addresses privacy risks related to the **Snipping Tool** [1] [2]
                    (also called **screen capture** [3]) and its earlier forms, **Snip & Sketch** [1] [4]
                    and **Screen Sketch** [4].

                    The Snipping Tool enables users to capture screenshots [2] [5] and record their screens [2].
                    This capability can expose sensitive information displayed on the screen unintentionally.

                    Earlier versions had significant privacy vulnerabilities, allowing recovery of cropped
                    screenshot portions [6] [7].
                    For example, bank details edited out of a saved screenshot could still be extracted by
                    malicious entities [6].
                    Although updates have remedied these issues in modern versions [6], the potential for
                    data exposure remains a concern.

                    Disabling this tool enhances privacy by preventing unintentional capture of sensitive
                    information and protecting against vulnerabilities.

                            It allows users to capture, edit, and share screenshots [3].

                            In recent Windows versions, this app is part of the *Windows Feature Experience Pack*

                            This script disables snipping functionality on older Windows versions.
                            privacy.sexy does not remove the entire Windows Feature Experience Pack,
                            as it contains many other essential functions [7].

                            This script prevents the Print Screen key from launching the Snipping Tool.

                            This is the default Windows behavior starting from Windows 11 22H2 [1].

                            The script targets the `HKCU\Control Panel\Keyboard\PrintScreenKeyForSnippingEnabled` registry key.
                            This key toggles the setting "Use the Print screen button to open screen snipping" in the control panel [1] [2] [3].
                            Changing this setting through the user interface also modifies this registry entry [3].
                            This key is absent by default in modern Windows versions, confirmed through testing starting with Windows
                            10 22H2 and Windows 11 23H2, which indicates that the Print Screen shortcut is enabled.

                            Applying these changes requires restarting File Explorer (`explorer.exe`) [3].
                            Both `explorer.exe` [4] and `Taskbar.dll` [5] reads this configuration at startup.

            It immediately terminates a specified process whenever it starts.
            The function adds `Debugger` registry value to point to the `taskkill.exe` utility, a command-line tool used for terminating processes.
            This effectively means that every time the process attempts to start, `taskkill.exe` is invoked instead, leading to the immediate termination of the process.

            This function uninstalls a non-removable app by marking it as removable and then
            running the built-in app uninstallation process.

            Process:

            1. Mark package as 'EndOfLife':
              - Sets EndOfLife key in `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Appx\AppxAllUserStore\EndOfLife\<User SID>\<Package Family Name>` [1] [2].
                This enables removal of normally non-removable apps [1] [2], preventing uninstallation failure (error `0x80070032`).
              - No packages are marked as 'EndOfLife' by default (tested on Windows 10 Pro ≥ 22H2 and Windows 11 Pro ≥ 23H2).
              - Even though this script deletes this key right after app removal, it's also removed on revert to restore default OS state.
                This handles cases where the key might remain (e.g., manual addition, third-party tools, incomplete script execution), as keeping this
                key may have unintended side effects.
            2. Uninstall store app using Windows' built-in app package removal
            3. Remove 'EndOfLife' mark:
               - Deletes the EndOfLife key added in step 1
               - Restores the app to its default, non-removable state
               - Prevents potential side effects like blocking Windows Updates [3].

        name: UninstallNonRemovableStoreAppWithCleanup # ❗️ Prefer `UninstallNonRemovableStoreApp` for new scripts
        # 💡 Purpose:
        #   This function is designed for comprehensive cleanup, removing the store app along with associated data such as installation directories, user data, and metadata.
        #
        #   It is maintained primarily for backward compatibility, supporting users who need to reverse changes made by earlier versions of privacy.sexy scripts that included app data removal.
        #   Historically, due to limitations in uninstalling non-removable apps through Windows package management tools (like `Remove-AppxPackage`), earlier versions of privacy.sexy scripts
        #   relied on a soft-deletion approach for app data. Newer scripts can now effectively use Windows package management to remove such apps.
        #
        #   For general usage in new scripts, prefer `UninstallNonRemovableStoreApp`. It offers a simpler, safer, and less invasive approach. The extensive cleanup performed by
        #   this function is typically unnecessary for most users.

            This function disables both system-wide and per-user services for a specified service.

            Windows creates per-user services when a user signs in and deletes them upon sign-out [1].
            Per-user services use the naming format <service name>_LUID, where LUID is a locally unique identifier for the user context [1].
            Per-user services have system-wide counterparts with the same default startup mode [1].
            These services can only be disabled using registry modifications [1].
            They are hidden from the **Services** management console and not displayed in the group policy services policy editor [1].

                # - PowerShell commands (`Unregister-ScheduledTask` and `Get-ScheduledTask`) sometimes fail to find existing tasks.
                #   Seen e.g. on Windows 11 when reverting scripts after executing them and reboot.

                #           - ❌ Not using `(Get-ScheduledTask $taskName -ErrorAction Ignore).State -eq 'Running'
                #                because `Get-ScheduledTask `sometimes fails.
                #           - ✅ Using `(Get-ScheduledTaskInfo $taskName).LastTaskResult -eq 267009` where "267009" indicates running.
                #       Deleting existing task:
                #           - ❌ Not using `Unregister-ScheduledTask $taskName -Confirm:$false` because it sometimes fails with `0x80070002`

        # ℹ️ Behavior:
        #   Searches for files and directories based on a Unix-style glob pattern and iterates over them.
        #   Similar to the `ls` command.
        #   Primarily supports the `*` wildcard; compatibility with other patterns is not tested.
        # 💡 Usage:
        #   This is a low-level function. Favor using other functions in script calls.
        #   It provides following variables for the code in argument value:
        #       - `$expandedPath`       : Expanded path glob pattern.
        #       - `$path`               : Current iterated path (only available for `duringIteration`)

                #   Granting permissions has limitations for wildcard due to `takeown` and `icacls`. These commands are used for their simplicity to avoid adjusting token privileges.
                #   However, adjusting token privileges is already implemented by `SoftFileDelete`, when this kind of implementations are reusable, this script can be improved to
                #   use `Get-Acl`, `Set-Acl` instead for better wildcards support. When using `Get-Acl`, `Set-Acl`, think also about a way to handle when the user is lacking "List Folder"
                # Considerations for using `Get-Acl` and `Set-Acl`:
                #   These commands may encounter issues when the user lacks "List Folder" permissions on a parent directory, which is essential for the `DeleteGlob` function.
                #   This is robustly handled by `takeown`.
                #     `takeown` effectively handles scenarios where the user lacks "List Folder" permissions.
                #     It requires a localized 'yes' flag, which varies with the system language ('y' for English).
                #     To find the localized 'yes', the script uses the `choice` command. This approach is simpler and more reliable
                #     than parsing `takeown /?`, which has proven to be inconsistent across different languages.
                #   For future enhancements:
                #       - Explore handling folder listing permission issues when transitioning to `Get-Acl` and `Set-Acl`.

            This function disables specific hotkeys that combine the Windows key with another key.

            Windows Explorer registers nearly two dozen such combinations as global hotkeys, primarily
            for taskbar-related functionalities [1].
            Although these settings are not extensively documented [1], they are acknowledged by Microsoft [2].

            The function modifies the registry key `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer!DisabledHotkeys` [1] [3] [4].
            The specified alphabetical character must be provided in uppercase for the registry data [1].
            This adjustment requires a restart of the explorer process (`explorer.exe`) [3] [5] or a system restart [4].

            > **Caution**:
            > Disabling a character will block all hotkey combinations that use it [1] [4].
            > For example, disabling "V" affects both `Win-V` and `Win-Shift-V` [1] [4].
            > See the [Microsoft Support page](https://web.archive.org/web/20240424105403/https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/keyboard-shortcuts-in-windows-dcc61a57-8ff0-cffe-9796-cb9706c75eec)

            This function disables the specified TLS protocol by modifying the registry
            settings under the `SCHANNEL\Protocols` subkey [1] [2] [3] [4].

            This action prevents the Windows operating system from using the protocol during
            SSL/TLS communications, enhancing system security by eliminating older or less secure
            protocols that might be susceptible to attacks.

            The function executes several commands to update the Windows registry.
            It sets `Enabled` and `DisabledByDefault` for both `Server` and `Client` configurations
            as recommended in various security guidelines [1] [2] [3] [4].

            This function enables of specific TLS protocols by modifying registry entries at
            `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols` [1] [2].

            By setting the `DisabledByDefault` registry key to `0`, the it enables the system to negotiate
            the use of protocols that might otherwise not be used by default [1].

            By setting the `Enabled` registry key to '1', it explicitly allows the use of the protocol [1], overriding
            any system defaults that might otherwise prohibit its use [3].

            On reverting the changes, it deletes the registry values, effectively restoring the original protocol settings.
            The default Windows installation does not include values under the `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols`
            registry subtree, as confirmed by tests on Windows 10 22H2 Pro and Windows 11 23H2 Pro.

            > **Caution**: Enabling a TLS protocol may not always be safe on certain Windows versions, as experimental support
            > for some protocols can lead to system instability [4] [5].

            It affects the following .NET Framework versions:

            - `v4.0.30319`: Used for configurations pertaining to .NET Framework 4 and later versions [1] [2] [3].
            - `v2.0.50727`: Targets .NET Framework 3.5 settings [1] [3].

            Note that there are no version-based keys such as `v3.0` or `v3.5`, ensuring that only recognized versions are configured.

            The `Wow6432Node` within the registry path indicates compatibility adjustments for 32-bit applications running on 64-bit machines
            it is absent in purely 32-bit environments [4].

            These settings are applied globally, affecting all .NET applications on the system.
            The configurations include enabling features or protocols that might not be active by default, depending on the framework version.

            It configures settings globally, affecting all .NET applications [1].

            When reverting changes, the function removes the specified keys to restore settings to their original state.
            On standard Windows installations, no other subkeys exist under the `.NETFramework\{version}\` registry path besides
            `v4.0.30319\AspNetEnforceViewStateMac!AspNetEnforceViewStateMac` [3], as tested since Windows 10 Pro 22H2 and Windows 11 23H2 Pro.

            This function prevents specified executable files from running on Windows through the `DisallowRun` policy.

            Users cannot execute these blocked programs via the Run dialog [1], double-clicking [1], the File menu [1], File Explorer [2] [3],
            or any application using `ShellExecute` or `ShellExecuteEx` functions [1].

            This function does not block executables launched by system processes like Task Manager or through other processes, including those
            initiated via the command prompt (`cmd.exe`) [2] [3].

            The script targets the `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer\DisallowRun` registry key [1] [2] [3],
            which does not exist by default.

            - **Via User Settings**:
              Local user settings for Edge (Legacy) are stored at
              `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppContainer\Storage\microsoft.microsoftedge_8wekyb3d8bbwe\MicrosoftEdge` [3] [4].
              This path is operational on versions of Windows with Legacy Edge installed and was tested on Windows 10 Pro 19H1 (1909).
              The path does not exist in modern versions of Windows tested from Windows 10 Pro (≥ 22H2) onwards.

        docs: |-
            This function deletes license data for a specific Visual Studio product GUID.

            Visual Studio stores license data in the registry in
            `HKCR\Licenses\<Product GUID>\<Numeric Value>!(Default)` [1] [2].
            Each numeric subkey contains a default value with binary license data.

            `HKCR` is a virtual view combining `HKCU\Software\Classes` and `HKLM\Software\Classes` [3].
            The actual license data is stored in `HKLM\Software\Classes`.

            This function removes the entire registry key for the given product GUID,
            including all subkeys and values, effectively deleting the license.

            This function deletes registry values within the specified registry key.

            It can operate in two modes: non-recursive (default) and recursive:

            1. Non-recursive mode (default):
              - Deletes all values directly under the specified key
              - Preserves the key itself and any subkeys
              - Does not affect values in subkeys
              - The behavior is equivalent to `reg delete /va "<path>" /f` [1].
            2. Recursive mode:
              - Deletes all values under the specified key
              - Deletes all values in all subkeys recursively
              - Preserves the key structure (keys and subkeys remain, only values are deleted)

        parameters:
            - name: folderClsid # A GUID representing a CLSID for a specific folder, used in Windows registry operations
        docs: |-
            This function hides specific folders from the "This PC" view in Windows Explorer using their CLSIDs.

            The script uses CLSIDs (Class Identifiers) that represent special folders in the OS [1].
            These CLSIDs can be opened and tested using [2]:

            ```batchfile
            explorer.exe shell:::{CLSID}
            ```

            Script behavior differs based on the Windows version.

            ### Windows 11

            On Windows 11, it sets:

            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\NameSpace\{<Folder CLSID>}!HiddenByDefault` [3]
            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\NameSpace\{<Folder CLSID>}!HideIfEnabled` [3]

            Community reports suggest that the `HiddenByDefault` and `HideIfEnabled` method is effective only on certain Windows 11 versions [3].

            ### Windows 10 and below

            On Windows 10 and below, it deletes (only working configuration, tested since Windows 10 Pro ≥ 22H2):

            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\NameSpace\{<Folder CLSID>}` [4]
            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MyComputer\NameSpace\{<Folder CLSID>}` [4]

            This method is reported to have also worked on Windows 8.1 [4].

            Tests show that setting this value requires restarting `explorer.exe` on Windows 10.

            This function removes shortcuts from "This PC" in Explorer [1] [2].
            It does not affect shortcuts in "Quick Access"[1].

            This function sets the default behavior on Windows 11, as user folders from "This PC"
            have already been removed [3].

            Microsoft documents folder IDs in their source code [4].

            The script modifies these registry keys:

            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FolderDescriptions\{<Folder GUID>}\PropertyBag!ThisPCPolicy`:
              Hides folder at machine level [1] [2].
            - `HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FolderDescriptions\{<Folder GUID>}\PropertyBag!ThisPCPolicy`:
              Same as above, but for 64-bit OS [2].
            - `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\HideMyComputerIcons!{<Folder GUID>}`:
              Hides folders at user level [1].

            One must restart Explorer (`explorer.exe`) for changes to take affect [3].
            This has been verified by tests on Windows 10 Pro (≥ 22H2).

            This function removes application associations from the Windows registry.

            It modifies the `HKCU|HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ApplicationAssociationToasts`
            registry subkey.
            This key in Windows stores user preferences for file type and application associations.
            When a user opens a file with a non-default application, Windows may display a "toast" notification
            suggesting the use of the default application for that file type. 
            The user's response to this suggestion is recorded in the ApplicationAssociationToasts registry key.
            This allows Windows to remember the user's application preferences for specific file types
            and determine whether to show the notification again in the future.

            This function will delete the association only if the specified ProgID matches the given file extension or URL protocol.
            If the ProgID is associated with a different file type or URL, the association remains untouched.

            This function removes the `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\<File Extension>\UserChoice!<ProgID>`
            registry key [1] [2].

            ### Testing

            Test results for different Windows version when removing `.htm` assocation:

            | Windows version | Delete | Re-add | Delete without ACLs | Re-add without ACLs | Deny ACLs  | Owner | Has Owner Full Control |
            | --------------- |:------:|:------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:----------:|-------|:----------------------:|
            | Windows 10 Pro 1903 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | 1 | Administrators | ✅ Yes |
            | Windows 10 Pro 1909 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | 1 | Administrators | ✅ Yes |
            | Windows 10 Pro 20H2 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | 1 | Administrators | ✅ Yes |
            | Windows 10 Pro 21H2 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | 1 | Administrators | ✅ Yes |
            | Windows 11 Pro 21H2 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | 1 | Administrators | ✅ Yes |
            | Windows 10 Pro 22H2 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | 1 | Administrators | ✅ Yes |
            | Windows 11 Pro 22H2 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | 1 | Administrators | ✅ Yes |
            | Windows 11 Pro 23H2 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | 1 | Administrators | ✅ Yes |
            
            These registry keys are protected by deny ACLs, which prevent programmatic modifications.
            To work around this limitation, the script temporarily removes these deny ACLs to allow changes.

            However, the .pdf association at `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.pdf\UserChoice` is a special case.
            This value can be deleted but not re-created on newer Windows versions.
            This behavior is likely due to tamper protection introduced in Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 22H2 onwards  [2], though official documentation is lacking.
            The following table shows the results for the `.pdf` file association:

            | Windows version | Delete | Re-add | Delete without ACLs | Re-add without ACLs | Deny ACLs  | Owner | Has Owner Full Control |
            | --------------- |:------:|:------:|:-------------------:|:-------------------:|:----------:|-------|:----------------------:|
            | Windows 10 Pro 1903 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | 1 | Administrators | ✅ Yes |
            | Windows 10 Pro 1909 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | 1 | Administrators | ✅ Yes |
            | Windows 10 Pro 20H2 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | 1 | Administrators | ✅ Yes |
            | Windows 10 Pro 21H2 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | 1 | Administrators | ✅ Yes |
            | Windows 11 Pro 21H2 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | 1 | Administrators | ✅ Yes |
            | Windows 10 Pro 22H2 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | 1 | Administrators | ✅ Yes |
            | Windows 11 Pro 22H2 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | 1 | Administrators | ✅ Yes |
            | Windows 11 Pro 23H2 | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | 1 | Administrators | ✅ Yes |

            registry key [1] [2].

            Removing it causes Windows to reset the association when the user signs in [2].

            On revert, it does not restore the associated software for user URLs because this registry key is protected on modern versions
            of Windows (confirmed on Windows 10 Pro 22H2 and later, and Windows 11 Pro 22H2 and later) due to a new tamper protection mechanism [1].

            ### Testing

            Test results for different Windows version when removing `http` assocation:

            | Windows 11 Pro 21H2 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | None | Administrators | ✅ Yes |
            | Windows 10 Pro 22H2 | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | None | Administrators | ✅ Yes |
            | Windows 11 Pro 22H2 | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | None | Administrators | ✅ Yes |
            | Windows 11 Pro 23H2 | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | None | Administrators | ✅ Yes |

            This table shows that these registry keys have the necessary permissions granted to the administrator, but
            since Windows 10 Pro 22H2 and Windows 11 Pro 22H2, re-adding this key still results in "Access is denied" errors.
            This key is protected by another undocumented mechanism.

            Tests show that not all `UrlAssociations` subkeys are protected, but some (such as `http`) are.
            For example, editing `bingmaps` works fine, but browser values such as `http` and `https`
            result in "Access is denied" errors.

            The data in table is collected by running this PowerShell script:

            This function disables push/toast notifications for a given application by modifying registry
            keys associated with Windows notification settings.

            These application user model IDs (AppUserModelId) are extensively used by the Windows taskbar to
            associate processes, files, and windows with particular applications [1].
            Notifications in Windows point to these IDs [2] [3].
            Existence of these IDs can be verified by checking `HKCR\AppUserModelId\{{ appUserModelId }}`
            registry key.

            The function performs the following registry operations:

            - Configures `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Notifications\Settings\{{ appUserModelId }}!Enabled`.
              - This mirrors the behavior when a user disables notifications via the Windows UI [4].
              - These values do not exist by default on newer Windows versions (Windows 10 Pro ≥ 22H2, Windows 11 Pro ≥ 23H2).
            - Soft-deletes the key `HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PushNotifications\Applications\{{ appUserModelId }}`.
              - This key is typically owned by TrustedInstaller and may contain application-specific notification configurations [2].
              - Soft-deletes the key `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PushNotifications\Backup\{{ appUserModelId }}`.
            - This key is typically registered by default for each notifying application [3].

            This function recursively renames a specified registry key, all its subkeys, and all their
            values by adding ".OLD" suffix.

            It provides an alternative to deleting registry keys when:

            - Preserving permissions on revert are important as renaming would preserve the original OS permissions.
            - Default OS settings are deep or contains multiple values, this way the original revert data is preserved.

            ### Order of processing

            For a sample registry structure:

            ```
            Root key
            ├── Value 1
            ├── Value 2
            ├── Value 3
            ├── Subkey 1
            │   ├── Value 1
            │   └── Value 2
            └── Subkey 2
                ├── Value 1
                └── Value 2
            ```

            The order of soft deletion would be:

            1. Rename root key values (Value 1, Value 2, Value 3)
            2. Rename Subkey 1 values (Value 1, Value 2)
            3. Rename Subkey 1 itself
            4. Rename Subkey 2's values (Value 1, Value 2)
            5. Rename Subkey 2 itself
            6. Rename the root key

            The revert process supports recovering from partially failed soft deletion:

            1. Restore root key
            2. Restore root key values (Value 1, Value 2, Value 3)
            3. Restore Subkey 1 itself
            4. Restore Subkey 1 values (Value 1, Value 2)
            5. Restore Subkey 2 itself
            6. Restore Subkey 2's values (Value 1, Value 2)

                    #    Use bottom-up traversal to avoid permission errors due to lack of parrent access.
                    #  - Handle copy and delete separately to avoid leftover copies on failure.
                    #    `Rename-Item` keeps a copy when it fails.
                    #  - Modify ACL object before `Set-Acl` to ensure populated data.

            This function configures **Enhanced Phishing Protection** in **Microsoft Defender SmartScreen** [2].
            This feature is technically known as `WebThreatDefense` [1] [2] [3].
            It was introduced in Windows 11 [3] and available only for Windows 11 versions [2].

            The function sets the following registry key paths:

            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WTDS\Components`:
              This is used to set Group Policy Objects (GPOs) [2].
            - `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WTDS\Components`:
              This key lacks official documentation.
              The component responsible for this functionality (`webthreatdefsvc.dll`) reads these configurations for its operation [3].
              Tests (conducted on Windows 11 version 23H2 and later) show that access to this registry key requires `TrustedInstaller` privileges.
