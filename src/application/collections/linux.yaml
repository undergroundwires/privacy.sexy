                  This script targets the Firefox browsing history, including URLs, downloads, bookmarks, and site visits, by deleting specific database entries.

                  Firefox stores various user data in a file named `places.sqlite`. This file includes:

                  - Annotations, bookmarks, and favorite icons (`moz_anno_attributes`, `moz_annos`, `moz_favicons`) [1]
                  - Browsing history, a record of pages visited (`moz_places`, `moz_historyvisits`) [1]
                  - Keywords and typed URLs (`moz_keywords`, `moz_inputhistory`) [1]
                  - Item annotations (`moz_items_annos`) [1]
                  - Bookmark roots such as places, menu, toolbar, tags, unfiled (`moz_bookmarks_roots`) [1]

                  The `moz_places` table holds URL data, connecting to various other tables like `moz_annos`, `moz_bookmarks`, `moz_inputhistory`, and `moz_historyvisits` [2].
                  Due to these connections, the script removes entries from all relevant tables simultaneously to maintain database integrity.
                  
                  **Bookmarks**: Stored across several tables (`moz_bookmarks`, `moz_bookmarks_folders`, `moz_bookmarks_roots`) [3], with additional undocumented tables like `moz_bookmarks_deleted` [4].

                  **Downloads**: Stored in the 'places.sqlite' database, within the 'moz_annos' table [5]. The entries in `moz_annos` are linked to `moz_places` that store the actual history entry
                  (`moz_places.id = moz_annos.place_id`) [6]. Associated URL information is stored within the 'moz_places' table [5]. Downloads have been historically stored in `downloads.rdf` for Firefox 2.x
                  and below [7], and `downloads.sqlite` later on [7].

                  **Favicons**: Older Firefox versions stored favicons in `places.sqlite` within the `moz_favicons` table [5], while newer versions use `favicons.sqlite` and the `moz_icons` table [5].

                  By executing this script, users can ensure their Firefox browsing history, bookmarks, and downloads are thoroughly removed, contributing to a cleaner and more private browsing experience.

            name: Clear system crash report files
            docs: |-
              The `/var/crash` directory holds system crash dumps according to Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) [1].

              You may get reports on a system's boot when crash report files exist.
              When the `/var/crash` directory contains files, Apport will display notifications [2].
              This directory is then cleaned up by Apport using [`/etc/cron.daily/apport`](https://web.archive.org/web/20221029220300/https://www.apt-browse.org/browse/ubuntu/precise/main/all/apport/2.0.1-0ubuntu5/file/etc/cron.daily/apport) job [6].
              Read more: ["Apport | Ubuntu Wiki"](https://web.archive.org/web/20221029220354/https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Apport).

              The folder typically contains kernel crash dumps [3], but it can be used by other applications as well.
              E.g., the Debian package corekeeper stores user-space coredumps in subfolders of `/var/crash` [4].
              Some systems, such as Ubuntu also put userspace crashes in this folder [5].

              When using systemd to start services or processes, the crash logs are stored in the `/var/lib/systemd/coredump/`
              directory [7].

        docs: |-
          A temporary folder or temporary directory is a directory used to hold temporary files [1].

          In Unix and Linux, the global temporary directories are `/tmp` [2] and `/var/tmp` [1]. Typically,
          `/var/tmp` is for persistent files (as it may be preserved over reboots), and `/tmp` is for more
          temporary files [1].

          Programs do not assume that any files or directories in temporary folders are preserved between
          invocations of the program, and these files may be deleted after reboot and in a site-specific manner [2].

              The `/var/cache` directory contains cached files, i.e. files that were generated and can be
              re-generated at any time, but they are worth storing to save time recomputing them [1].
              The application must be able to regenerate or restore the data [2], so the system can delete
              the contents of /var/cache either periodically or when its contents get too large [1].
              However, there is no guarantee that applications will follow the specification, but this is
              very rare.

              It's not only used by applications but also by the operating system. This may include OS folders
              such as [2]:
              - Locally-generated fonts (`/var/cache/fonts`)
              - Locally-formatted manual pages (`/var/cache/man`)

    category: Disable OS data collection
    docs: |-
      All operating systems collect data. This is part of their work. Sometimes, this data has
      high privacy implications, especially when it is submitted to third parties. Some Linux
      distributions come with out-of-the-box data collection and submission. Most of the time,
      this data collection is opt-in, but not necessarily always.

      Data collection and telemetry is not always a bad thing, and can help developers provide
      better software that can compete with proprietary and much more privacy-invasive alternatives.

              in different distros such as Debian and Ubuntu [2].

              `popularity-contest` package sets up a cron job that will periodically anonymously submit statistical data

              data about the system architecture and the version of popularity-contest [4].

              Communication is encrypted but with the right configuration and software, but if that's not the case, communication
              can be eavesdropped as it does not use HTTPS but HTTP [4].

                  Apport intercepts program crashes, collects debugging information about the
                  crash and the operating system environment, and sends it to bug trackers in a
                  standardized form [1]. It also allows the user to report a bug about a package
                  by collecting as much information about it as possible [1].

                  Disabling Apport prevents the UI which informs the user about the crash and instructs
                  them on how to proceed because that dialog is part of Apport [2] [3]. Furthermore,
                  Apport creates crash report files in the `/var/crash` directory, and having files
                  in this directory causes an error message to appear every time Ubuntu boots [4].

                  Apport collects potentially sensitive data, such as core dumps, stack traces,
                  and log files [2]. It can contain passwords, credit card numbers, serial numbers,
                  and other private information [2].

                  Bug reports are shared with the [Ubuntu bug triaging team](https://web.archive.org/web/20221029222122/https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-crashes-universe) [2].

                  Apport is disabled by default in stable releases due to the sensitive data it collects [2].

                  Apport only uploads data if the package `whoopsie` is installed; otherwise it appears
                  to be uploading but does not upload [3].

                docs: |-
                  The software responsible for uploading crash reports is called Whoopsie [1].
                  It's always running on Ubuntu systems, watching the `/var/crash` directory for crash reports
                  (that usually Apport creates) to send over the internet to Canonical servers at `http://daisy.ubuntu.com`
                  for further processing [1]. Along with the crash report, it sends a unique identifier (GUID)
                  for your computer [1] in `/etc/default/whoopsie` [2].

                  Apport only uploads data if package `whoopsie` is installed; otherwise it appears
                  to be uploading but does not upload [3].

        category: Disable Zeitgeist activity logging
        docs: |-
          Zeitgeist logs files opened, websites visited, conversations, and emails and provides
          this information over an API to applications [1].
          It serves as a comprehensive activity log and also makes it possible to determine
          relationships between items based on usage patterns [1].

          It stores computer use actions such as files accessed, sites visited, and conversations held.
          The data is typically used to facilitate searches and "best-fit" to your local query only.

          There's no proof that it's uploading data.
          It does **not** send data over the network but still makes the system more vulnerable by storing
          usage information that can be used for further exploitation.

          It is primarily used by desktop environments such as GNOME [2], Pantheon [3], and Unity [4].
          Furthermore, it is supported by applications (typically as optional functionality) such as
          Gnome Rhythmbox (as a plugin) [5], catfish (optional support) [6], and synapse [7].

        name: Disable connectivity checks (breaks Captive Portal detection)
        docs: |-
          [NetworkManager](https://web.archive.org/web/20221029223230/https://developer-old.gnome.org/NetworkManager/stable/NetworkManager.conf.html) can try
          to reach a web server after connecting to a network in order to determine if it is, e.g., behind a captive portal [1].

          Disabling connectivity protects against privacy leaks [1], but breaks captive portal detection.

          Connectivity URLs differ depending on the Linux distribution, e.g.:
          - Arch Linux: `http://ping.archlinux.org/nm-check.txt` (in `/usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/20-connectivity.conf`) [1].
          - Ubuntu: `http://connectivity-check.ubuntu.com` [2] (in `/usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/20-connectivity-ubuntu.conf` [3]).
          - Pop!_OS: `http://204.pop-os.org/` in `20-connectivity-pop.conf` [4].
          - Fedora: `http://fedoraproject.org/static/hotspot.txt` [5] in `/usr/lib/NetworkManager/conf.d/20-connectivity-fedora.conf` [6].
          - …

          This script disables connectivity checks by adding a global rule that will override Linux distribution-specific configuration.
          This is the recommended way to disable connectivity checks [1].

        name: Disable Python history for future interactive commands
        docs: |-
          Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language [1].
          Most Python implementations (including CPython) include a [read-eval-print loop (REPL)](https://web.archive.org/web/20221029223210/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop),
          permitting them to function as a command-line interpreter for which users enter statements sequentially and receive results immediately [1].

          Python saves interactive commands in the `~/.python_history` file [2] [3].
          This script ensures that this file is immutable by changing the file attributes [4], so Python can no
          longer update the file.

        docs: |-
            Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor made by Microsoft [1].

            Visual Studio Code makes outgoing network requests to collect data in the background without users invoking
            a feature that requires online access [2]. The requests include, but are not limited to, automatic extension
            update checks, querying settings for A/B experiments, and fetching online data for auto-completion [2].

            In addition, Visual Studio Code collects and transmits telemetry data to Microsoft servers, such as [3]:
            - Diagnostic information about your system and usage is sent to Microsoft servers [3].
            - Your usage data and data about feature performance [3].

                The `telemetry.telemetryLevel` preference can be adjusted as follows [1]:

                - `default` (on): Transmits usage data, errors, and crash reports.
                - `error`: Transmits general error telemetry and crash reports.
                - `crash`: Transmits OS-level crash reports.
                - `off`: Disables all product telemetry.

                This script disables telemetry data, which includes usage data, errors, and crash reports.

                The `telemetry.enableTelemetry` was the primary option to disable telemetry collection [2].
                This disabled the collection of diagnostic data [3].
                However, it has been deprecated and replaced by the `telemetry.telemetryLevel` setting [4] [5].

                Crash reports use a unique ID to identify you [6]. They were initially controlled using the
                `telemetry.enableCrashReporter` setting [7], but this setting has been deprecated and replaced by
                the `telemetry.telemetryLevel` setting [7].

                default in earlier versions [2].

                The `git.autofetch` setting controls this feature, with `true` enabling it and

                docs: |-
                  Web browsers, including Firefox, save various data types such as cookies, cache, and site-specific details.
                  While this data helps in providing a faster and personalized browsing experience, it can be exploited by websites to track
                  your activities across the internet, potentially compromising your privacy.

                  State partitioning, also known as "Total Cookie Protection" [1], is a feature designed to enhance user privacy in Firefox.
                  It works by allocating different, isolated storage spaces for every website you visit [2]. This means that each website has its own
                  "compartment" where it saves its data, separate from other sites [2]. This structure limits websites' capabilities to track users
                  across various domains.

                  The underlying technology for state partitioning in Firefox is termed "double-keying" [1]. In this method, when a website intends
                  to store data, Firefox attaches an extra identifier tied to the site's origin, ensuring unique data storage for each site [1]. For
                  example, if two different sites incorporate content from the same third-party source, each of these sites will have its own unique
                  version of the third-party's data (like cookies) due to state partitioning [1]. This impedes the third-party's tracking ability
                  between the sites.

                  This protection isn't just against known trackers [1]. Firefox applies state partitioning to all third-party content on a site,
                  ensuring a comprehensive privacy coverage, beyond just identifiable tracking sources [1] [3].

                  A notable misuse by some trackers is the creation of "supercookies" [4]. Contrary to standard cookies, which users can delete easily,
                  supercookies are harder to eliminate and block, posing a considerable privacy challenge. Through state partitioning, Firefox renders
                  supercookies ineffective for tracking users across sites [4]. As a part of this feature, Firefox not only ensures site-specific data
                  but also partitions multiple caches, such as HTTP cache, image cache, and favicon cache [4]. This partitioning prevents any potential
                  cache exploitation for tracking purposes [4].

                  In summary, enabling state partitioning in Firefox is a powerful privacy tool, helping to defend users from potential online tracking
                  and offering a more private browsing experience.

                    docs: |-
                      Dynamic First-Party Isolation, also known as dFPI, is an advanced privacy feature in Firefox. This feature commonly
                      referred to as:

                      - Total Cookie Protection [1],
                      - dFPI (dynamic First-Party Isolation) [2],
                      - Dynamic storage partitioning [3].

                      Essentially, dFPI is an enhanced version of a previous privacy tool known as First-Party Isolation (FPI) [4].

                      The primary purpose of dFPI is to improve user privacy online. It accomplishes this by preventing third-party websites from
                      accessing or tracking a user's data across different websites [1] [3].

                      By default, this feature is activated for all Firefox desktop users [5].

                      Within Firefox's settings, there's an option called `network.cookie.cookieBehavior` which governs how dFPI operates.
                      This setting has three potential values [3]:

                      - `5`: The browser will block known trackers and partition storage for third-party content.
                      - `4`: Only known trackers will be blocked without any partitioning of third-party storage.
                      - `0`: All trackers and third-party content are allowed.

                      This script sets the value to `5`, ensuring the highest level of privacy by blocking trackers and partitioning third-party
                      storage. This aligns with recommended privacy practices because even if you choose the `4` value, the older First-Party
                      Isolation (FPI) will still be active [6].

                      Network partitioning is a method used by Firefox to enhance user privacy [1]. When enabled, each website you visit has its own
                      isolated storage location, preventing it from accessing data from another website [1]. This limits the ability of websites to track
                      users across multiple sites [1].

                      Network Partitioning, formerly referred to as *cache partitioning* [2], is a subset of state partitioning [1]. While state partitioning
                      deals with data like cookies, network partitioning deals with networking-related components, such as caches and connection pools [1].
                      It ensures that these components are isolated to each website, further enhancing user privacy [1].

                      Firefox has enabled network partitioning by default since version 85 [1]. Once enabled, network partitioning becomes permanent,
                      meaning websites cannot bypass or weaken its restrictions [1].

                      Network partitioning can be controlled with the `privacy.partition.network_state` preference [1].

                      First-party isolation (FPI) helps in preventing third parties from tracking users across multiple websites [1] [2]. This is sometimes

                      This script disables FPI in favor of a newer technology called dynamic First-Party Isolation (dFPI) for the following reasons:

                      1. FPI and dFPI conflict with each other, and they cannot function simultaneously [3] [4]. Additionally, Mozilla doesn't plan to make
                      them compatible [5].
                      2. FPI has been marked as deprecated and is expected to be phased out [3], with dFPI set to become the standard in the future [6].
                      3. dFPI, when combined with network partitioning, offers broader and more effective privacy coverage than FPI, being essentially a
                      superset of FPI [3] [7].

                  This feature also includes protections against harmful scripts such as malware that drains
                  your battery [1].

                  This script enables the `privacy.resistFingerprinting` preference,
                  activating anti-fingerprinting [1][2].

                  Beyond privacy advantages; enabling tracking protection may reduce load time by 44% [3].

                  Note: If you are already using an ad blocker with the correct lists, tracking protection might
                  be redundant.

                  Fingerprinting Protection is a heavily developed experimental feature in Firefox [1].
                  As part of a project to integrate features from the Tor Browser, Mozilla launched an
                  anti-fingerprinting project in Firefox [2].

              By default, Firefox collects telemetry data [1]. This data comprises two main categories:
              **interaction data** and **technical data** [1].

              **Interaction data** includes metrics such as the number of open tabs and windows, the number of
              webpages visited, the number and type of installed Firefox Add-ons, session length, and
              interactions with features offered by Mozilla or third parties. These features may include
              Firefox search features and search partner referrals [1].

              **Technical data** provides information about your Firefox version and language, device operating
              system and hardware configuration, memory, basic crash and error information, as well as the
              outcome of automated processes like updates and safe browsing [1].

              Note that Firefox logs your personally identifiable IP address [1].

                      1. `toolkit.telemetry.shutdownPingSender.enabled`: This preference permits the shutdown ping
                      to be sent when the browser is closed from the second browsing session onwards, as opposed
                      to on the next restart, through the ping sender [2].
                      2. `toolkit.telemetry.shutdownPingSender.enabledFirstSession`: This preference allows the
                      shutdown ping to be sent through the ping sender from the first browsing session [2].
                      3. `toolkit.telemetry.firstShutdownPing.enabled`: This preference permits a duplicate of
                      the main shutdown ping from the first browsing session to be sent as a separate
                      `first-shutdown` ping [2].

            docs: |-
              This script turns off the Firefox Captive Portal detection feature.

              Firefox uses this feature to determine if a network connection requires a login, such as a
              public Wi-Fi hotspot [1]. The test involves initiating an outgoing connection to Mozilla servers [1].

              By default, these connection attempts occur at regular intervals [2][3].

              This functionality could potentially expose your usage habits [4]. For instance, a public venue
              like a hotel or restaurant might require you to input a password for internet access. If such a
              portal is in place and blocking traffic, this feature prevents all other connection attempts,
              possibly revealing your usage habits.

            docs: |-
              Firefox's Safe Browsing feature, now referred to as Phishing Protection, is still internally
              recognized as "Safe Browsing" [1].

              To provide protection against phishing and malware, Firefox transmits the following data:

              1. Partial address information for visited webpages [2].
              2. Details such as name, origin, size, and hash of contents for downloaded files [2].

              This data is sent to Google Safe Browsing [2] to aid in issuing warnings for downloaded files and
              visited sites [2].

              While Phishing Protection bolsters your security, it may decrease your privacy as it involves
              sending data about the websites you visit and files you download to Google [1][2].

              There have been concerns about the potential for Google Safe Browsing to be used for censorship
              in the future, although this has not occurred as of yet [3].

                  Disabling this feature might have mixed implications:

                  - Disabling the blocking of unstable plugins can potentially expose the user to vulnerabilities associated with these plugins.
                  These plugins may include malware, which would compromise user privacy and data.
                  - It removes the need for data communication via Mozilla servers `addons.mozilla.org` for list retrieval [2]. This feature requires
                  frequent requests to download large amount of data.

                  If this blocking is removed, the user should be knowledgeable about the potential risks and will take precautions.

                  This preference dictates whether to enable malware checks [1].

      This script modifies the `user.js` file in Firefox profiles to set specific preferences.

      The `user.js` file can be found in a Firefox profile folder [1] and its location depends on the type of installation:

      - Default: `~/.mozilla/firefox/<profile-name>/user.js`
      - Flatpak: `~/.var/app/org.mozilla.firefox/.mozilla/firefox/<profile-name>/user.js`
      - Snap: `~/snap/firefox/common/.mozilla/firefox/<profile-name>/user.js`

      While the `user.js` file is optional [2], if it's present, the Firefox will prioritize its settings over
      those in `prefs.js` upon startup [1] [2]. It's recommended not to directly edit `prefs.js` to avoid profile corruption [2].

      When `user.js` is modified or deleted, corresponding changes in `prefs.js` are necessary for reversion, as Firefox
      doesn't automatically revert these changes [3].

      This script safely modifies `user.js` and ensures changes are reflected in `prefs.js` during reversion, addressing
      issues with preference persistence [3].
