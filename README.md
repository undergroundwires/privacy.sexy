## Get started

- 🌍️ **Online**: [https://privacy.sexy](https://privacy.sexy).
- 🖥️ **Offline**: Check [releases page](https://github.com/undergroundwires/privacy.sexy/releases), or download directly for: [Windows](https://github.com/undergroundwires/privacy.sexy/releases/download/0.11.2/privacy.sexy-Setup-0.11.2.exe), [macOS](https://github.com/undergroundwires/privacy.sexy/releases/download/0.11.2/privacy.sexy-0.11.2.dmg), [Linux](https://github.com/undergroundwires/pr.vacy.sexy/releases/download/0.11.2/privacy.sexy-0.11.2.AppImage).

Online version does not require to run any software on your computer. Offline version has more functions such as running the scripts directly.

💡 You should apply your configuration from time to time (more than once). It would strengthen your privacy and security control because privacy.sexy and its scripts get better and stronger in every new version.
