## Get started

- Online version: [https://privacy.sexy](https://privacy.sexy)
- Or download latest desktop version for [Windows](https://github.com/undergroundwires/privacy-sexy/releases/download/0.5.0/privacy.sexy-Setup-0.5.0.exe), [Linux](https://github.com/undergroundwires/privacy-sexy/releases/download/0.5.0/privacy.sexy-0.5.0.dmg), [macOS](https://github.com/undergroundwires/privacy-sexy/releases/download/0.5.0/privacy.sexy-0.5.0-mac.zip)

## Why

- You don't need to run any compiled software that has access to your system, just run the generated scripts.
- Have full visibility into what the tweaks do as you enable them.
- Ability to revert applied scripts
- Easily extendable
- Everything is open-sourced including both application and infrastructure
  - Fully automated CI/CD pipeline using GitHub actions
    - to AWS for provisioning serverless infrastructure
    - for building and sharing the desktop applications

## Extend scripts

- Fork it & add more scripts in [application.yaml](src/application/application.yaml) and send a pull request üëå
- üìñ More: [extend scripts | CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#extend-scripts)

## Commands

- Project setup: `npm install`
- Testing
  - Run unit tests: `npm run test:unit`
  - Lint: `npm run lint`
- **Desktop app**
  - Development: `npm run electron:serve`
  - Production: `npm run electron:build` to build an executable
- **Webpage**
  - Development: `npm run serve` to compile & hot-reload for development.
  - Production: `npm run build` to prepare files for distribution.
  - Or run using Docker:
    1. Build: `docker build -t undergroundwires/privacy.sexy:0.5.0 .`
    2. Run: `docker run -it -p 8080:80 --rm --name privacy.sexy-0.5.0 undergroundwires/privacy.sexy:0.5.0`

## Architecture

### Application

- Powered by **TypeScript** + **Vue.js** üí™
  - and driven by **Domain-driven design**, **Event-driven architecture**, **Data-driven programming** concepts.
- Application uses highly decoupled models & services in different DDD layers.
  - **Domain layer** is where the application is modelled with validation logic.
  - **Presentation Layer**
    - Consists of Vue.js components and other UI-related code.
    - Desktop application is created using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).
    - Event driven as in components simply listens to events from the state and act accordingly.
  - **Application Layer**
    - Keeps the application state
      - The [state](src/application/State/ApplicationState.ts) is a mutable singleton & event producer.
    - The application is defined & controlled in a [single YAML file](src/application/application.yaml) (see [Data-driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-driven_programming))

### AWS Infrastructure

[![AWS solution](docs/aws-solution.png)](https://github.com/undergroundwires/aws-static-site-with-cd)

- It uses infrastructure from the following repository: [aws-static-site-with-cd](https://github.com/undergroundwires/aws-static-site-with-cd)
  - Runs on AWS 100% serverless and automatically provisioned using [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/).
  - Maximum security & automation and minimum AWS costs are the highest priorities of the design.

#### GitOps: CI/CD to AWS

- CI/CD is fully automated for this repo using different GIT events & GitHub actions.
  - Versioning, tagging, creation of `CHANGELOG.md` and releasing is automated using [bump-everywhere](https://github.com/undergroundwires/bump-everywhere) action
- Everything that's merged in the master goes directly to production.
