Web tool to generate scripts for enforcing privacy & security best-practices such as stopping data collection of Windows and different softwares on it.

[https://privacy.sexy](https://privacy.sexy)

## Why

- You don't need to run any compiled software on your system, just run the generated scripts.
- It's open source, both application & infrastructure is 100% transparent
  - Fully automated C/CD pipeline to AWS for provisioning serverless infrastructure using GitHub actions.
- Have full visibility into what the tweaks do as you enable them.
- Easily extendable

## Extend scripts

Fork it & add more scripts in [application.yaml](src/application/application.yaml) and send a pull request üëå

## Commands

- Setup and run
  - For development:
    - `npm install` to project setup.
    - `npm run serve` to compile & hot-reload for development.
  - Production (using Docker):
    - Build `docker build -t undergroundwires/privacy.sexy .`
    - Run `docker run -it -p 8080:8080 --rm --name privacy.sexy-1 undergroundwires/privacy.sexy`
- Prepare for production: `npm run build`
- Run tests: `npm run test:unit`
- Lint and fix files: `npm run lint`

## Architecture

### Application

- Powered by **TypeScript** + **Vue.js** üí™
  - and driven by **Domain-driven design**, **Event-driven architecture**, **Data-driven programming** concepts.
- Application uses highly decoupled models & services in different DDD layers.
  - **Domain layer** is where the application is modelled with validation logic.
  - **Presentation Layer**
    - Consists of Vue.js components & UI stuff.
    - Event driven as in components simply listens to events from the state and act accordingly.
  - **Application Layer**
    - Keeps the application state
      - The [state](src/application/State/ApplicationState.ts) is a mutable singleton & event producer.
    - The application is defined & controlled in a [single YAML file](`\application\application.yaml`) (see [Data-driven programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-driven_programming))

### AWS Infrastructure

[![AWS solution](docs/aws-solution.png)](https://github.com/undergroundwires/aws-static-site-with-cd)

- It uses infrastructure from the following repository: [aws-static-site-with-cd](https://github.com/undergroundwires/aws-static-site-with-cd)
  - Runs on AWS 100% serverless and automatically provisioned using [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/).
  - Maximum security & automation and minimum AWS costs are the highest priorities of the design.

#### GitOps: CI/CD to AWS

- Everything that's merged in the master goes directly to production.
- See more at [build-and-deploy.yaml](.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yaml), and [run-tests.yaml](.github/workflows/run-tests.yaml)

## Thank you for the awesome projects üç∫

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) the only big JavaScript framework that's not backed by companies that make money off your data.
- [liquor-tree](https://GitHub.com/amsik/liquor-tree) for the awesome & super extensible tree component.
- [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/) for code box.
- [FileSaver.js](https://GitHub.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js) for save file dialog.
- [chai](https://GitHub.com/chaijs/chai) & [mocha](https://GitHub.com/mochajs/mocha) for making testing fun.
- [js-yaml-loader](https://GitHub.com/wwilsman/js-yaml-loader) for ahead of time loading `application.yml`
- [v-tooltip](https://GitHub.com/Akryum/v-tooltip) takes seconds to have a tooltip, exactly what I needed.
