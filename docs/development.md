# Development

Before your commit, a good practice is to:

1. [Run unit tests](#testing)
2. [Lint your code](#linting)

You could run other types of tests as well, but they may take longer time and overkill for your changes. Automated actions executes the tests for a pull request or change in the main branch. See [ci-cd.md](./ci-cd.md) for more information.

## Commands

### Prerequisites

- Install node >15.x.
- Install dependencies using `npm install`.

### Testing

- Run unit tests: `npm run test:unit`
- Run integration tests: `npm run test:integration`
- Run end-to-end (e2e) tests:
  - `npm run test:cy:open`: Run tests interactively using the development server with hot-reloading.
  - `npm run test:cy:run`: Run tests on the production build in a headless mode.
- Run checks:
  - `npm run check:desktop`: Run runtime checks for packaged desktop applications ([README.md](./../tests/checks/desktop-runtime-errors/check-desktop-runtime-errors/README.md)).
    - You can set environment variables active its flags such as `BUILD=true SCREENSHOT=true npm run check:desktop`
  - `npm run check:external-urls`: Test whether external URLs used in applications are alive.

ðŸ“– Read more about testing in [tests](./tests.md).

### Linting

- Lint all (recommended ðŸ’¡): `npm run lint`
- Markdown: `npm run lint:md`
- Markdown consistency `npm run lint:md:consistency`
- Markdown relative URLs: `npm run lint:md:relative-urls`
- JavaScript/TypeScript: `npm run lint:eslint`
- Yaml: `npm run lint:yaml`

### Running

**Web:**

- Run in local server: `npm run dev`
  - ðŸ’¡ Meant for local development with features such as hot-reloading.
- Preview production build: `npm run preview`
  - Start a local web server that serves the built solution from `./dist`.
  - ðŸ’¡ Run `npm run build` before `npm run preview`.

**Desktop apps:**

- `npm run electron:dev`: The command will build the main process and preload scripts source code, and start a dev server for the renderer, and start the Electron app.
- `npm run electron:preview`: The command will build the main process, preload scripts and renderer source code, and start the Electron app to preview.
- `npm run electron:prebuild`: The command will build the main process, preload scripts and renderer source code. Usually before packaging the Electron application, you need to execute this command.
- `npm run electron:build`: Prebuilds the Electron application, packages and publishes it through `electron-builder`.

**Docker:**

1. Build: `docker build -t undergroundwires/privacy.sexy:latest .`
2. Run: `docker run -it -p 8080:80 --rm --name privacy.sexy undergroundwires/privacy.sexy:latest`

### Building

- Build web application: `npm run build`
- Build desktop application: `npm run electron:build`
- (Re)create icons (see [documentation](../img/README.md)): `npm run create-icons`

### Utility Scripts

- Run fresh NPM install: [`./scripts/fresh-npm-install.sh`](../scripts/fresh-npm-install.sh)
  - This script provides a clean NPM install, removing existing node modules and optionally the package-lock.json (when run with -n), then installs dependencies and runs unit tests.
- Configure VSCode: [`./scripts/configure-vscode.sh`](../scripts/configure-vscode.sh)
  - This script checks and sets the necessary configurations for VSCode in `settings.json` file.

## Recommended extensions

You should use EditorConfig to follow project style.

For Visual Studio Code, [`.vscode/extensions.json`](./../.vscode/extensions.json) includes list of recommended extensions.
