# Development

Before your commit, a good practice is to:

1. [Run unit tests](#testing)
2. [Lint your code](#linting)

You could run other types of tests as well, but they may take longer time and overkill for your changes.
Automated actions are set up to execute these tests as necessary.
See [ci-cd.md](./ci-cd.md) for more information.

## Commands

### Prerequisites

- Install Node.js:
  - Refer to [action.yml](./../.github/actions/setup-node/action.yml) for the minimum required version compatible with the automated workflows.
  - ðŸ’¡ Recommended: Use [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) CLI to install and switch between Node.js versions.
- Install dependencies using `npm install` (or [`npm run install-deps`](#utility-scripts) for more options).
- For Visual Studio Code users, running the configuration script is recommended to optimize the IDE settings, as detailed in [utility scripts](#utility-scripts).

### Testing

- Run unit tests: `npm run test:unit`
- Run integration tests: `npm run test:integration`
- Run end-to-end (e2e) tests:
  - `npm run test:cy:open`: Run tests interactively using the development server with hot-reloading.
  - `npm run test:cy:run`: Run tests on the production build in a headless mode.
- Run checks:
  - `npm run check:desktop`: Run runtime checks for packaged desktop applications ([README.md](./../tests/checks/desktop-runtime-errors/check-desktop-runtime-errors/README.md)).
    - You can set environment variables active its flags such as `BUILD=true SCREENSHOT=true npm run check:desktop`
  - `npm run check:external-urls`: Test whether external URLs used in applications are alive.

ðŸ“– Read more about testing in [tests](./tests.md).

### Linting

- Lint all (recommended ðŸ’¡): `npm run lint`
- Markdown: `npm run lint:md`
- Markdown consistency `npm run lint:md:consistency`
- Markdown relative URLs: `npm run lint:md:relative-urls`
- JavaScript/TypeScript: `npm run lint:eslint`
- Yaml: `npm run lint:yaml`

### Running

**Web:**

- Run in local server: `npm run dev`
  - ðŸ’¡ Meant for local development with features such as hot-reloading.
- Preview production build: `npm run preview`
  - Start a local web server that serves the built solution from `./dist`.
  - ðŸ’¡ Run `npm run build` before `npm run preview`.

**Desktop apps:**

- `npm run electron:dev`: The command will build the main process and preload scripts source code, and start a dev server for the renderer, and start the Electron app.
- `npm run electron:preview`: The command will build the main process, preload scripts and renderer source code, and start the Electron app to preview.
- `npm run electron:prebuild`: The command will build the main process, preload scripts and renderer source code. Usually before packaging the Electron application, you need to execute this command.
- `npm run electron:build`: Prebuilds the Electron application, packages and publishes it through `electron-builder`.

**Docker:**

1. Build: `docker build -t undergroundwires/privacy.sexy:latest .`
2. Run: `docker run -it -p 8080:80 --rm --name privacy.sexy undergroundwires/privacy.sexy:latest`
3. Application should be available at [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080)

### Building

- Build web application: `npm run build`
- Build desktop application: `npm run electron:build`
- (Re)create icons (see [documentation](../img/README.md)): `npm run create-icons`

### Scripts

ðŸ“– For detailed options and behavior for any of the following scripts, please refer to the script file itself.

#### Utility scripts

- [**`npm run install-deps [-- <options>]`**](../scripts/npm-install.js):
  - Manages NPM dependency installation, it offers capabilities like doing a fresh install, retries on network errors, and other features.
  - For example, you can run `npm run install-deps -- --fresh` to do clean installation of dependencies.
- [**`python3 ./scripts/configure_vscode.py`**](../scripts/configure_vscode.py):
  - Optimizes Visual Studio Code settings and installs essential extensions, enhancing the development environment.
- [**`python3 ./scripts/validate-collections-yaml`**](../scripts/validate-collections-yaml/README.md):
  - Validates the syntax and structure of collection YAML files.
- [**`python3 ./scripts/add_missing_ids.py`**](../scripts/add_missing_ids.py):
  - Adds unique `id` fields to scripts and categories lacking them in collection files.

#### Automation scripts

- [**`node scripts/print-dist-dir.js [<options>]`**](../scripts/print-dist-dir.js):
  - Determines the absolute path of a distribution directory based on CLI arguments and outputs its absolute path.
- [**`npm run check:verify-build-artifacts [-- <options>]`**](../scripts/verify-build-artifacts.js):
  - Verifies the existence and content of build artifacts. Useful for ensuring that the build process is generating the expected output.
- [**`node scripts/verify-web-server-status.js --url [URL]`**](../scripts/verify-web-server-status.js):
  - Checks if a specified server is up with retries and returns an HTTP 200 status code.

## Recommended extensions

You should use EditorConfig to follow project style.

For Visual Studio Code, [`.vscode/extensions.json`](./../.vscode/extensions.json) includes list of recommended extensions.
You can use [VSCode configuration script](#utility-scripts) to automatically install those.
