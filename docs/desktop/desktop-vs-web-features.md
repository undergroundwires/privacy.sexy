## Feature descriptions

### Usage without installation

You can use the web version directly in a browser without installation.
The desktop version requires download and installation.

> **Note for Linux users:** On Linux, privacy.sexy is available as an `AppImage`, a portable format that doesn't need traditional installation.
> This allows Linux users to use the desktop version without full installation, akin to the web version.

### Offline usage

The web version, once loaded, supports offline use.
Desktop version inherently allows offline usage.

### Auto-updates

Both the desktop and web versions of privacy.sexy provide timely access to the latest features and security improvements. The updates are automatically deployed from source code, reflecting the latest changes for enhanced security and reliability. For more details, see [CI/CD documentation](./../ci-cd.md).

The desktop version ensures secure delivery through cryptographic signatures and version checks.

[Security is a top priority](./../../SECURITY.md#update-security-and-integrity) at privacy.sexy.

> **Note for macOS users:** On macOS, the desktop version's auto-update process involves manual steps due to Apple's code signing costs.
> Users get notified about updates but might need to complete the installation manually.

### Logging

The desktop version supports logging of activities to aid in troubleshooting.
This feature is not available in the web version.

Log file locations vary by operating system:

- macOS: `$HOME/Library/Logs/privacy.sexy`
- Linux: `$HOME/.config/privacy.sexy/logs`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\privacy.sexy\logs`

> 游눠 privacy.sexy provides scripts to securely erase these logs.

### Script execution

The desktop version of privacy.sexy enables direct script execution, providing a seamless and integrated experience.
This direct execution capability isn't available in the web version due to inherent browser restrictions.

**Script execution history:**

For enhanced auditability and easier troubleshooting, the desktop version keeps a record of executed scripts in designated directories.
These locations vary based on the operating system:

- macOS: `$HOME/Library/Application Support/privacy.sexy/runs`
- Linux: `$HOME/.config/privacy.sexy/runs`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\privacy.sexy\runs`

> 游눠 privacy.sexy provides scripts to securely erase your script execution history.

### Error handling

The desktop version of privacy.sexy features advanced error handling capabilities.
It employs robust and reliable execution strategies, including self-healing mechanisms, and provides guidance and troubleshooting information to resolve issues effectively.
In contrast, the web version has more basic error handling due to browser limitations and the nature of web applications.

### Native dialogs

The desktop version uses native dialogs, offering more features and reliability compared to the browser's file system dialogs.
These native dialogs provide a more integrated and user-friendly experience, aligning with the operating system's standard interface and functionalities.

### Secure script execution/storage

**Integrity checks:**

The desktop version of privacy.sexy implements robust integrity checks for both script execution and storage.
Featuring tamper protection, the application actively verifies the integrity of script files before executing or saving them.
If the actual contents of a script file do not align with the expected contents, the application refuses to execute or save the script.
This proactive approach ensures only unaltered and verified scripts undergo processing, thereby enhancing both security and reliability.
Due to browser constraints, this feature is absent in the web version.

**Error handling:**

In scenarios where script execution or storage encounters failure, the desktop application initiates automated troubleshooting and self-healing processes.
It also guides users through potential issues with filesystem or third-party software, such as antivirus interventions.
Specifically, the application is capable of identifying when antivirus software blocks or removes a script, providing users with tailored error messages
and detailed resolution steps. This level of proactive error handling and user guidance enhances the application's security and reliability,
offering a feature not achievable in the web version due to browser limitations.
